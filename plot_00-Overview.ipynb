    "\n",
    "To include synonyms, just add more entries to the input list of terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple strings within the same list are combined with the 'OR' operator. This means\n",
    "results will be returned if they include any of the given terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the set of search terms ['brain', 'cortex'] is interpreted as:\n",
    "'(\"brain\"OR\"cortex\")'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to include synonyms is the reason each term entry is itself a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusion & Exclusion Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we might need to control the returned results, by specifically including\n",
    "or excluding certain topics or results. We can do so by adding 'inclusion' and/or\n",
    "'exclusion' words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inclusions words are words that must also appear for a result to be returned.\n",
    "Inclusions words are combined with the 'AND' operator, meaning entries\n",
    "will only be included if they also include these words.\n",

    "For example, the search terms ['brain', 'cortex'] with the inclusion word ['biology']\n",
    "is interpreted as '(\"brain\"OR\"cortex\")AND(\"biology\")'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exclusions words are words that must not be included in a result for it to be returned.\n",

    "\n",
    "Synonyms, inclusion and exclusion words can all be used together.\n",

    "\n",
    "- search terms ['brain', 'cortex']\n",
    "- inclusion words ['biology', 'biochemistry']\n",
    "- exclusion words ['body', 'corporeal']\n",
