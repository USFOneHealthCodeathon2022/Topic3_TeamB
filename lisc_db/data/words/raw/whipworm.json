Pregnant women are among at risk groups for the infection of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). STHs are highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries due to the deprived environmental sanitation and personal hygiene. Eating soil (geophagia) is also commonly practiced by pregnant women, particularly in developing countries. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of STHs and geophagia, and to assess associated factors among pregnant women in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia. A cross sectional study was conducted among 407 pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) at different health facilities located in Jimma Town. Data related to sociodemographic and geophagia practice was collected using a structured questionnaire and STH infections status was determined by using McMaster technique. A total of 407 pregnant women were included in this study. The overall prevalence of any STHs was 19.7% (80/407). Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent 45(56.2%), followed by Trichuris trichiura 19(23.8%) and hookworms 12(15%). There were 4(5%) of double infection with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Overall, 71 (17.4%) of the pregnant women responded to practice geophagia. STHs infection was significantly higher among geophagic pregnant women (p<0.01) and pregnant women who practiced geophagia were 3 times more likely (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-4.2) to have the STHs compared to non-geophagic. Out of those who claimed soil eating habits, 59.1% preferred reddish soil type. Geophagia practice was significantly higher during the third trimester as compared to first and second (p<0.05). Geophagia is a risky behavior and this study showed a significant association of geophagia practice with STH infections, although the causal relation could not be established.", "keywords": ["Ethiopia", "Geophagia", "Jimma", "Pregnant women", "STHs"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.4314/ejhs.v31i5.16"}

Focusing on bacterial pathogens, increased detection rates could be confirmed for enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli with a tendency for an increase in Campylobacter jejuni detections during the rainy season, while there was no seasonal effect on the carriage of Tropheryma whipplei. Salmonellae were recorded during the rainy season only. A differentiated pattern was seen for the assessed parasites. Entamoeba histolytica, Necator americanus and Trichuris trichiura were increasingly detected during the rainy season, but not Ascaris lumbricoides, Giardia duodenalis, Hymenolepis nana, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Taenia solium, respectively.

A recombinant vaccine composed of Tm-WAP49, an immunodominant antigen secreted by adult Trichuris stichocytes into the mucosa of the cecum to which the parasite attaches, is under development. The prototype is being evaluated in a mouse model of Trichuris muris infection, with the ultimate goal of producing a mucosal vaccine through intranasal delivery. Intranasal immunization of mice with Tm-WAP49 formulated with the adjuvant OCH, a truncated analog of alpha-GalCer with adjuvanticity to stimulate natural killer T cells (NKT) and mucosal immunity, induced significantly high levels of IgG and its subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2a) in immunized mice. This also resulted in a significant reduction of worm burden after challenge with T. muris-infective eggs. The addition of QS-21 adjuvant to this vaccine formulation further reduced worm counts. The improved protection from the dual-adjuvanted vaccine correlated with higher serum antibody responses (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgA) as well as with the induction of antigen-specific IgA in the nasal mucosa. It was also associated with the robust cellular responses including functional subsets of CD4 T cells producing IL-4, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells expressing granzyme B. The worm reduction achieved by mucosal immunization was higher than that induced by subcutaneous immunization. Intranasal immunization also induced a significantly higher nasal mucosa-secreted antigen-specific IgA response, as well as higher functional cellular responses including CD4+IL4+ (Th1) and CD8+GnzB+ (Th2) T cells, and antigen-specific INF\u03b3-producing T cells in both spleen and MLNs and antibody-producing B cells (CD19+B220+/B220+GL7+). Mucosal immunization further induced long-term T lymphocyte memory with increased central (CD62L+CD44+) and effector (CD62L-CD44+) memory subsets of both CD4 and CD8 T cells at 60 days after the last immunization. In summary, intranasal immunization with recombinant Tm-WAP49 protein induced strong protection versus murine trichuriasis.

The lowest prevalence was noted for cestode eggs of Moniezia spp. (5.4% in WM and 3.0% in MM). The Willis method yielded a higher prevalence of eggs and oocysts than the modified McMaster method, and hence has a higher probability of detecting parasitic structures than the modified McMaster method, especially in cases of very low levels of invasion. As the two methods yield consistent results, it is recommended to use the Willis method for diagnosis of internal parasite infection in European bison.

After long-term mass distribution for onchocerciasis, ivermectin is expected to have additional benefits beyond the envisioned targets by reducing the burden of other co-endemic parasitic infections as to STHs. To date, studies focused on the collateral impact of CDTi on STH in Ethiopia are scanty. Two community-based cross-sectional surveys (baseline in 1997 and post-CDTi in 2017) were conducted to evaluate the impact of long-term CDTi employed to control and eliminate onchocerciasis on the burden of STH infections in Yeki district of southwest Ethiopia. Stool samples were collected and examined using Ritchie`s concentration and Kato-Katz techniques in the baseline and current study, respectively. Overall, 188(38.3%, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 34.1-42.7%) individuals were positive at least for any of the STH species from 491 study participants in the post-CDTi. The prevalence of A. lumbricoides, hookworms, and T. trichiura was 11.2% (95% CI 8.7-14.3%), 16.3% (95% CI 13.3-19.8%), and 29.9% (95% CI 26.1-34.1%), respectively. Individuals aged 5-9 years had a significantly higher prevalence of A. lumbricoides (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6.5, 95% CI 1.7-25.4), T. trichuria (AOR 8, 95% CI 2.6-25.1), and any STH infection (AOR 5, 95% CI 1.7-14.7) than those of \u2265 51 years. Also, significantly higher prevalences of T. trichuria infection were observed in individuals aged 10-14 years (AOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-9.9), 15-20 years (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.1), 21-30 years (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.5), and 31-40 years (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-7.5) compared with those of \u2265 51 years. The prevalence of A. lumbricoides was significantly higher in males (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9). Of the 491 study participants, only data from 400 individuals who had not been involved in a mass drug administration (MDA) with other STH anthelmintics were considered in the comparative analysis. Before CDTi, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, hookworm, and any STH infection was 47.1% (95% CI 41.6-52.7%), 3.3% (95% CI 1.8-5.9%), 37.9% (95% CI 32.7-43.5%), and 58.8% (95% CI 53.2-64.1%), respectively. Long-term CDTi considerably reduced the prevalences of A. lumbricoides and hookworm by 76.2% and 56.9%, respectively (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, CDTi did not affect the prevalence of T. trichiura infection and, in contrast, it was significantly higher in the current study (P < 0.001). Overall post-CDTi prevalence of any STH infection was considerably lower than reported in the baseline (p < 0.001). It is evidenced that long-term CDTi for onchocerciasis control and elimination had additional benefits by reducing the prevalence of STH infections specifically of A. lumbricoides and hookworm, but had no impact on infections with T. trichuria.

Many estimates of STH infection are often based on school-aged children (SAC). This study produced predictive risk-maps of STH on a more finite scale, estimated the number of people infected, and the amount of drug required for preventive chemotherapy (PC) in Ogun state, Nigeria. Georeferenced STH infection data obtained from a cross-sectional survey at 33 locations between July 2016 and November 2018, together with remotely-sensed environmental and socio-economic data were analyzed using Bayesian geostatistical modelling. Stepwise variable selection procedure was employed to select a parsimonious set of predictors to predict risk and spatial distribution of STH infections. The number of persons (pre-school ages children, SAC and adults) infected with STH were estimated, with the amount of tablets needed for preventive chemotherapy. An overall prevalence of 17.2% (95% CI 14.9, 19.5) was recorded for any STH infection. Ascaris lumbricoides infections was the most predominant, with an overall prevalence of 13.6% (95% CI 11.5, 15.7), while Hookworm and Trichuris trichiura had overall prevalence of 4.6% (95% CI 3.3, 5.9) and 1.7% (95% CI 0.9, 2.4), respectively. The model-based prevalence predictions ranged from 5.0 to 23.8% for Ascaris lumbricoides, from 2.0 to 14.5% for hookworms, and from 0.1 to 5.7% for Trichuris trichiura across the implementation units. The predictive maps revealed a spatial pattern of high risk in the central, western and on the border of Republic of Benin. The model identified soil pH, soil moisture and elevation as the main predictors of infection for A. lumbricoides, Hookworms and T. trichiura respectively. About 50% (10/20) of the implementation units require biannual rounds of mass drug administration. Approximately, a total of 1.1 million persons were infected and require 7.8 million doses. However, a sub-total of 375,374 SAC were estimated to be infected, requiring 2.7 million doses.

However, moisture on pastures is a crucial factor for the development of free-living stages of many parasite species in ruminants. Hence, for the first time, we conducted a field study between 2015 and 2017 at the German North Sea coast to investigate the long-term effect of pasture rewetting (since 2004) on endoparasite infections in sheep and cattle. We examined faecal samples of 474 sheep and 646 cattle from five farms in spring, summer and autumn each year for the presence of endoparasite infections. Animals were kept on conventionally drained, undrained and rewetted pastures. The association between pasture rewetting and endoparasite infection probability was analysed in generalized linear mixed models and including further potential confounders. Infection frequencies for gastrointestinal strongyles, Eimeria spp. and Strongyloides papillosus were significantly higher in sheep (62.9%, 31.7% and 16.7%) than in cattle (39.0%, 19.7% and 2.6%). Fasciola hepatica was detected with a frequency of 13.3% in sheep and 9.8% in cattle, while rumen fluke frequency was significantly higher in cattle (12.7%) than in sheep (3.8%). Nematodirus spp., lungworms (protostrongylids, Dictyocaulus viviparus), Moniezia spp., Trichuris spp. and Dicrocoelium dendriticum were identified in less than 7% of samples. Co-infection with more than three endoparasite taxa was present significantly more often in sheep than in cattle. We identified significant positive correlations above 0.2 for excretion intensities between S. papillosus with strongyles, Eimeria spp. and Nematodirus spp. in sheep and between strongyles and Nematodirus spp. in cattle. Pasture rewetting had no long-term effect on endoparasite infections, neither in sheep nor in cattle. Interestingly, F. hepatica infections decreased significantly in sheep and cattle from 2015 (10.9% and 13.9%) to 2017 (1.4% and 2.1%). Pasture rewetting for nature conservation did not increase endoparasite infection probability in ruminants in the long term. This finding should be confirmed in ongoing studies aimed at further animal welfare parameters.

The cumulative prevalence (proportion of children tested that positive at least once over the entire study period) was 56.1% for Trichuris and 31.8% for Ascaris. For Ascaris, re-infections were frequently observed, whereas for Trichuris, children often remained excreting eggs following drug administration.

This study, therefore, assessed the water consumption, wastewater generation rates, physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of wastewater produced from each process unit of an artisanal tannery in Ghana. The study revealed that the total amount of water use in the tannery ranged between 1171 and 2120L/day whilst the total volume of wastewater generated was within 820 and 1324L/day. Physicochemical characteristics of the different wastewater types generated at the tannery including chemical oxygen demand (13600-24333.30 mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (1445.64-2803 mg/L), ammonia (3.20-21.38 mg/L), colour (950.35-53900.10PtCo), electrical conductivity (8170 - 10080 \u03bcS/cm), turbidity (450.24-1805NTU), suspended (1033.50-3216.40 mg/L) and dissolved (26166.50-4996.65 mg/L) solids exceeded the guidelines set by the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency.

A total of 95.3% of children presented intestinal parasitism, most of whom (94.5%) infected by protozoa and 36.1% infected by soil-transmitted helminths (STH), with Trichuris trichiura (27.3%) being the most prevalent. Multiple infections were found to be high (83.8%), with protozoa and STH co-infections in 30.6%. STH infections were mainly of low/moderate intensity. Neither infection nor STH infection of any intensity profile, was significantly related to anemia. In addition, STH infection, regardless of the intensity profile, was not associated with stunting, underweight or thinness. There was no difference between genders nor among ages in odds of anemia and nutritional status in STH-infected schoolchildren.

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminths and associated factors among adolescents and adults in Bibugn Woreda, East Gojjam, Northwest Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Bibugn Woreda from February to September 2021. Using multistage proportionate sampling technique, 641 adolescents and adults were enrolled in this study. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and factors associated with helminthic infections was collected using structured questionnaire prepared in Amharic and administered through face-to-face interview. Parasite detection in stool samples was performed using modified formol-ether concentration and Kato-Katz techniques following standard protocols. Data was entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 25. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with soil-transmitted helminths infections. P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The overall prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths infection was 20.9% (134/641). The most detected parasite was Ascaris lumbricoides (12.5%), followed by hookworm species (7.5%) and Trichuris trichiura (1.1%).

As for malaria, rhythms within the immune system were shown to impact the developmental cycles of Plasmodium parasites within red blood cells. Further, host circadian rhythms impact infections by multicellular parasites; for example, infection with helminth Trichuris muris shows different kinetics of worm expulsion depending on time of day of infection, a variation that depends on the dendritic cell clock.

However, there have been no qualitative or quantitative syntheses of these studies, which show marked variation in participant age, diet, pathogen of interest, and study location. A predefined minimally biased search strategy identified 23 studies in humans. For each of these studies, we qualitatively addressed the effects of helminth infection on within-individual (alpha) and between-individual (beta) fecal microbiome diversity, infection-associated microbial taxa, the effect of helminth clearance on microbiome composition, microbiome composition as a predictor of infection status or treatment outcome, and treatment-specific effects on the fecal microbiome. Concomitantly, we performed a meta-analysis on a subset of 7 of these studies containing raw, paired-end 16S reads and individual-level metadata, comprising 424 pretreatment or untreated HI individuals and 497 HU controls. After reducing the batch effect and adjusting for age, our data demonstrated that intestinal helminth parasites can alter the host gut microbiome by increasing alpha diversity and promoting taxonomic reassortment and gradient collapse. Most strongly influencing the microbiome composition were the helminths found in the large intestine, Enterobius vermicularis and Trichuris trichiura, suggesting that this influence appears to be specific to soil-transmitted helminths (STH) species and host anatomical niche. In summary, using a large and diverse sample set captured in the meta-analysis, we were able to evaluate the influence of individual helminth species as well as species-species interactions, each of which explained a significant portion of the variation in the microbiome. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome has established importance in regulating many aspects of human health, including nutrition and immunity. While many internal and environmental factors are known to influence the microbiome, less is known about the effects of intestinal helminth parasites (worms), which together affect one-sixth of the world's population. Through a comprehensive qualitative systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of existing literature, we provide strong evidence that helminth infection dynamically shifts the intestinal microbiome structure. Moreover, we demonstrated that such influence seems to be specific to helminth species and host anatomical niche. Our findings suggest that the gut microbiome may underlie some of the pathology associated with intestinal worm infection and support future work to understand the precise nature of the helminth-microbiome relationship.", "keywords": ["helminth", "intestinal bacteria", "intestinal parasites", "microbiome", "nematodes", "soil-transmitted helminth"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1128/mBio.02890-21"}

Overall prevalence of moderate-heavy intensity Ascaris lumbricoides (6.6%) and Trichuris trichiura (2.7%) infection after initiation of preventive chemotherapy were significantly lower than the prevalence prior to initiation (23.6% for A. lumbricoides and 12.2% for T. trichiura). Prevalence reductions were also found in school and preschool-age children for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Studies conducted after preventive chemotherapy initiation had significantly lower overall prevalence of moderate-heavy intensity schistosomiasis (3.1% vs 0.2%) and of schistosomiasis in school-age children (30.5% vs 1%). Pooled prevalence of lymphatic filariasis prior to preventive chemotherapy initiation was 3.2% across 12 provinces, while currently only two provinces still have prevalence of more than 1%. There were no published studies reporting prevalence of lymphatic filariasis after initiation of preventive chemotherapy. Heterogeneity was high with I2 mostly above 90%. The burden of STH infections and schistosomiasis in children were significantly lower in studies conducted following the initiation of preventive chemotherapy.

This study assessed the infection burden of Plasmodium, Schistosoma species and STH infections among school children in communities in Southern and Northern Ghana. School children living in communities in Southern (Ada Foah, Pediatorkope, Tuanikope) and Northern (Kpalsogu) Ghana were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. A total of 493 (241 males and 252 females) school children aged (2-15\u00a0years) were enrolled in the study.

The early diagnosis of O. viverrini infection may interrupt the progression of the opisthorchiasis and other related illnesses, especially CCA. The current diagnostic procedure is stool examination by microscope-based methods such as direct smear and concentration techniques but it is limited by low parasite egg numbers. The molecular diagnosis prompts the chance to evaluate the light infection with low number of parasite eggs but is currently inconvenient for routine use due to special equipment requirement and unstable sensitivities. Our present study aims to establish the efficiency of OvNad subunits, the mitochondrial gene, for introducing as a potential diagnostic target by conventional PCR, the cheapest and easiest molecular procedure. A total of 166 stool samples were investigated microscopically by the PBS-ethyl acetate concentration technique (PECT); 75 samples were O. viverrini positive with 28 samples that were positive with single parasite (hookworm, A. lumbricoides, S. stercoralis, Taenia spp., and T. trichiura), 11 samples were with mixed infection, and 52 samples were without parasite detection. The detection limits of OvNad subunits were evaluated in artificially spiked samples containing 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Ov-eggs. The result suggested that the best detection efficacy was of OvNad5 that had exact detection limits at only 5 eggs. In the PCR amplification of OvNad subunits, there exist 100% specificities with varied sensitivities from 64%, 88%, 80%, and 100% of OvNad1, OvNad2, OvNad4, and OvNad5, respectively. OvNad subunits were amplified specifically without cross reactivity with the other collected parasites. Our study established that OvNad subunits, especially OvNad5, are the potent candidates for PCR amplification of stool containing Ov-eggs with high confidential sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV even in the light infection that would be a benefit for developing as a routine diagnosis of O. viverrini infection.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1155/2021/3957545"}

It is presently unknown which inactivating procedures may be universally effective for safe transport, preservation, and disinfection of STH-contaminated specimens, and this lack of knowledge may expose laboratory staff to higher risk of laboratory-acquired infections (LAI's). There are limited data on the efficacy of commonly used disinfectants and fecal fixatives for inactivating the eggs of STH. This work tested five disinfectants for surface cleanup, four storage temperature conditions, and six transport/storage fixatives, to inactivate eggs of three species of STH of animal origin (Ascaris suum \"roundworm,\" Trichuris vulpis \"whipworm\" and Ancylostoma caninum \"hookworm\") as surrogates for human STH. Among disinfectants, exposure to 10% povidone-iodine for \u22655 min inactivated 100% of the three species tested, while 5 min exposure to 95% ethanol inactivated T. vulpis and A. caninum eggs. All of the fixatives tested had inactivation effects on A. caninum hookworm eggs within 24\u2009h of exposure, except potassium dichromate, which required 48\u2009h. 95% ethanol for \u226548\u2009h inactivated eggs from all three STH species.

IMPORTANCE This study systematically evaluates common laboratory disinfectants and storage conditions for their effectiveness in inactivating the infective stages of soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Animal-infecting proxy species were chosen to represent three major groups of STH that infect humans: roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms. Previously published work in this area typically focuses on a particular inactivation method, either for a single STH species, or on a subset of closely related species. Because prediagnostic fecal specimens must be regarded as potentially infectious with a mix of species, such information may be of limited utility in a working laboratory. We provide a straightforward summary of storage and disinfection methods that can achieve complete inactivation across a range of STH species, which represents a significant advance for clinical, veterinary and research laboratory biosafety.", "keywords": ["STH", "biosafety", "helminth", "inactivation", "nematode", "parasite"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1128/Spectrum.01828-21"}

Since the drugs currently in use for the treatment of haemonchosis are losing their effectiveness due to the drug-resistance of this nematode, a new or repurposed drug is highly needed. As the antipsychotic drug sertraline (SRT) has been shown to be effective against the parasitic nematodes Trichuris muris, Ancylostoma caninum and Schistosoma mansoni, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible effect of SRT on H. contortus. The potential hepatotoxicity of SRT was tested in sheep, a common H. contortus host. In addition, the main metabolic pathways of SRT in H.\u00a0contortus and the ovine liver were identified. While no effect of SRT on H. contortus egg hatching was observed, SRT was found to significantly decrease the viability of H. contortus adults in drug-sensitive and resistant strains, with its effect comparable to the commonly used anthelmintics levamisole and monepantel. Moreover, SRT in anthelmintically active concentrations showed no toxicity to the ovine liver. Biotransformation of SRT in H. contortus was weak, with most of the drug remaining unmetabolized. Production of the main metabolite hydroxy-SRT did not differ significantly between strains. Other minor metabolites such as SRT-O-glucoside, dihydroxy-SRT, and SRT-ketone were also identified in H. contorts adults. Compared to H.\u00a0contortus, the ovine liver metabolized SRT more extensively, mainly via desmethylation and glucuronidation. In conclusion, the potency of SRT against H. contortus was proven, and it should be tested further toward possible repurposing.", "keywords": ["Drug repurposing", "drug metabolism", "drug resistance", "hepatotoxicity", "nematodes"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1186/s13567-021-01012-x"}

Little is known about the intestinal nonpathogenic bacterial composition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated by immunotherapy. To determine whether there is a correlation between gut bacterial composition and prognosis in HCC patients. From September 2019 to March 2020, we prospectively collected fecal samples and examined the gut microbiome of 8 advanced HCC patients treated with nivolumab as a second- or third-line systemic treatment. Fecal samples were collected before the start of immunotherapy. Fecal samples of patients with progression during treatment were collected at the time of progression, and fecal samples of patients who showed good response to nivolumab were collected after 5-7 mo as follow-up. Metagenomic data from 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench. Microbiome data were analyzed according to therapeutic response. All 8 patients were male, of which 6 had underlying chronic hepatitis B. A higher Shannon index was found in the responders than in the non-responders after nivolumab therapy (P = 0.036). The unweighted beta diversity analysis also showed that the overall bacterial community structure and phylogenetic diversity were clearly distinguished according to therapeutic response. There was no significant difference in the diversity or composition of the patient gut microbiome according to the immunotherapy used. Several taxa specific to therapeutic response were designated as follows: Dialister pneumosintes, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus reteri, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus gordonii, Veillonella atypica, Granulicatella sp., and Trchuris trichiura for the non-responders; Citrobacter freundii, Azospirillum sp. and Enterococcus durans for the responders. Of note, a skewed Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and a low Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio can serve as predictive markers of non-response, whereas the presence of Akkermansia species predicts a good response. The current presumptive study suggests a potential role for the gut microbiome as a prognostic marker for the response to nivolumab in treatment of HCC patients.", "keywords": ["Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio", "Hepatocellular carcinoma", "Microbiome", "Nivolumab", "Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio", "Prognosis"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3748/wjg.v27.i42.7340"}

Institution based cross sectional study was conducted at SGH, Ethiopia using consecutive convenient sampling technique during 1 January to 30 April, 2021. Data was collected by interviewing and capillary blood was taken from the fingertip for hemoglobin determination by using HaemoCue digital photometer. Additionally, stool sample was processed using wet mount and formal-ether concentration technique.

However, these drugs are less effective against Trichuris trichiura. Combined ivermectin-albendazole is a promising treatment alternative, yet robust evidence is lacking. We aimed to demonstrate superiority of co-administered ivermectin-albendazole over albendazole monotherapy in three distinct epidemiological settings. We conducted a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3, randomised controlled trial in community members aged 6-60 years infected with T trichiura in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, Tanzania, between Sept 26, 2018, and June 29, 2020. Participants with at least 100 T trichiura eggs per g of stool at baseline were randomly assigned (1:1) using computer-generated randomisation sequences in varying blocks of four, six, and eight, stratified by baseline T trichiura infection intensity, to orally receive either a single dose of ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg) plus albendazole (400 mg) or albendazole (400 mg) plus placebo. Patients, field staff, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was cure rate against T trichiura, defined as the proportion of participants with no eggs in their faeces 14-21 days after treatment, assessed by Kato-Katz thick smears, and analysed in the available-case population according to intention-to-treat principles. Safety was a secondary outcome and was assessed 3 h and 24 h after drug administration. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03527732. Between Sept 13 and Dec 18, 2019, Jan 12 and April 5, 2019, and Sept 26 and Nov 5, 2018, 3737, 3694, and 1435 community members were screened for trial eligibility in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, respectively. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, 256, 274, and 305 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned to the albendazole group, and 255, 275, and 308, respectively, to the ivermectin-albendazole group. Primary outcome data were available for 722 participants treated with albendazole and 733 treated with ivermectin-albendazole. Ivermectin-albendazole showed significantly higher cure rates against T trichiura than albendazole in Laos (66% [140 of 213]vs 8% [16 of 194]; difference 58 percentage points, 95% CI 50 to 65, p<0\u00b70001) and Pemba Island (49% [140 of 288]vs 6% [18 of 293], 43 percentage points, 36 to 49, p<0\u00b70001) but had similar efficacy in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (14% [32 of 232]vs 10% [24 of 235], 4 percentage points, -2 to 10, p=0\u00b724). No serious adverse events were reported; observed events were mostly classified as mild (95% [266 of 279] in the albendazole group and 91% [288 of 317] in the ivermectin-albendazole group), and all were transient in nature. Treatment with ivermectin-albendazole resulted in higher efficacy against trichuriasis than albendazole alone in Laos and Pemba Island but not in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. We recommend implementation of this combination therapy for soil-transmitted helminth control in countries with high T trichiura prevalence and proven enhanced efficacy of this treatment, particularly where ivermectin is beneficial against other endemic helminthiases.

A blood sample was obtained from a jugular venipuncture, and a rectal faecal sample was obtained. Taenia spp. circulating antigen levels in the sample sera were tested using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, apDia\u2122 cysticercosis Ag ELISA. The modified McMaster technique was used to identify and quantify the GI parasites. The apparent animal-level seroprevalence for PCC was 4.8% (95% CI 2.7-7.1) and differed across the two districts (p\u2009=\u20090.018). At the pig herd level, the prevalence was 9.7% (95% CI 5.5-14.4). The prevalence of the different nematode eggs and coccidian oocysts in the two districts was as follows: strongyles 79.0% (95% CI 74.3-83.6), coccidia 73.3% (95% CI 68.3-78.6), Trichuris spp. 7.4% (95% CI 4.9-10.6), Strongyloides ransomi 2.1 (95% CI 0.7-3.5) and Ascaris spp. 4.9 (95% CI 2.8-7.4). Overall, across the two districts, the arithmetic mean for the oocysts per gram (OPG) for coccidia was 2042.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095776.1, and eggs per gram (EPG) were the highest in strongyles 616.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009991. Overall, 57.4% of the porcine cysticercosis seropositive pigs were also positive for at least one of the gastrointestinal helminths which included strongyles, Strongyloides ransomi, Trichuris spp. and Ascaris spp. The co-infection status of pigs with both PCC and GI parasites demonstrated by this study can provide an incentive for integrating the control and management of both parasites with oxfendazole. Further studies are required to understand the feasibility of using oxfendazole including cost-benefit analysis and the acceptability by local stakeholders for the control of T. solium cysticercosis and gastrointestinal parasites in pigs.", "keywords": ["Co-infection", "Gastrointestinal parasites", "Porcine cysticercosis", "Taenia solium"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1007/s00436-021-07380-9"}

Repeated annual cross-sectional community surveys were conducted between 2013 and 2019 in individuals of 5 years and older. Primary outcome was the change of infection prevalence estimates from baseline to month 36 (12 months after the last treatment). After three rounds of annual MDA, Wuchereria bancrofti circulating filarial antigen (CFA) and microfilaria (Mf) prevalence estimates decreased from 19.7% to 4.3% and from 8.6% to 0%, respectively; after semiannual MDA, CFA and Mf prevalences decreased from 37.8% to 16.8% and 17.9% to 1%, respectively. Mixed effects logistic regression models indicated that the odds of having Mf decreased by 97% (P < 0.001) at month 36 (similar odds for annual and semiannual MDA zones). A parallel analysis showed that the odds of CFA were reduced by 83% and 69% at 36 months in the annual and semiannual treatment zones, respectively (P < 0.001). Onchocerca volvulus Mf prevalence decreased slightly after multiple MDA rounds in both treatment zones. Reductions in hookworm and Trichuris trichiura prevalences and intensities were slightly greater in the annual treatment zone. Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence rates were relatively unchanged, although infection intensities decreased sharply throughout. Results show that annual and semiannual MDA were equally effective for reducing LF and soil-transmitted helminth infection parameters over a 3-year period, and reductions recorded at month 36 were sustained by routine annual MDA through month 72.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.4269/ajtmh.21-0768"}

Stool samples were collected also from household members at the time of the child's birth and examined by microscopy. Data on social, environmental, and demographic characteristics were collected by maternal questionnaire. Associations between potential risk factors and STH infections were estimated using generalized estimated equations applied to longitudinal binary outcomes for presence or absence of infections at collection times.

In 2015, a total of 20 survey sites were sampled in 10 counties (cities) of Yunnan Province using the stratified cluster random sampling method. Stool samples were collected from all local permanent residents at ages of one year and older in each survey site, and the soil-borne nematode eggs were identified using the modified Kato-Katz technique and the egg number was counted. In addition, the hookworm species was identified using the filter-paperculture method, and Enterobius vermicularis eggs were detected using the cellophane tape method in children at ages of 3 to 6 years. A total of 5 067 residents received stool examinations, and 950 residents were detected with soil-borne nematode infections, with an overall prevalence rate of 18.75%. The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichura and hookworm was 7.52%, 8.47% and 9.02%, respectively. Among 446 children detected using the cellophane tape method, 5 children were detected with E. vermicularis infections. Among the 160 residents with hookworm infections, there were 139 residents with Necator americanus infections (86.88%), 16 with A. duodenale infections (10.00%) and 5 with mixed infections (3.12%). Mild A. lumbricoides (67.98%, 259/381), T. trichura (88.58%, 380/429) and hookworm infections (94.53%, 432/457) were predominant. Among the four ecological zones, the highest prevalence of human soilborne nematode infections was found in the East Tibet-South Sichuan Ecological Zone (31.79%), and among the 10 survey counties (cities), the greatest prevalence was seen in Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County (50.13%), while the lowest prevalence was found in Ninglang Yi Autonomous County (0.40%).

This study determined the distributions, determinants and dynamics of GWI and also the effect of the infection on production parameters in pigs reared in Enugu State, Nigeria. The GWI were determined by faecal egg counts following standard procedure. Sixty piggeries and 564 pigs were randomly selected for the study. Questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain data on some production parameters and risk practices aiding GWI in the piggeries. An overall prevalence of 88.3% (53/60) and 68.1% (384/564) at farm and individual pig levels respectively were recorded. High egg counts of single and mixed infections involving Strongyle, Ascaris and Trichuris species were found. The infection predominated in young (74.1%, 240/324) and female (72.3%, 272/376) pigs during the rainy/wet season (74.5%, 204/274). Rearing pigs of different ages together, feeding pigs with untreated abattoir/poultry waste, and unhygienic on-farm feed compounding were the major risk practices underpinning acquisition and spread of GWI. Infected piggeries had less litter weight and reduced mean weight at weaning and maturity. Pre-weaning piglet mortality was 15.5%. The seasonality and preponderance of the infection in young and female pigs are useful epidemiological findings which could be exploited for development of an effective control strategy against the parasitic infections. An overhaul of parasitic disease control measures in piggeries in Enugu State is imperative for greater productivity and profitability in swine production, and to boost availability of safe and wholesome pork for human consumption.

The toilet installation was located in a garden adjacent to a monumental structure with extraordinary architectural elements. A light microscope was used to identify and measure the eggs. The presence of four intestinal parasite egg taxa was detected: Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), Taenia sp. (beef/pork tapeworm), Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), and Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm). This is the earliest appearance of roundworm and pinworm in the ancient Israel parasitological record. Findings reveal that intestinal parasitic diseases most likely caused by poor sanitary conditions were a human problem in the Late Iron Age of Israel, affecting even high-status groups. The study demonstrates the potential of archaeoparasitological investigations to expand our knowledge of the origin and history of regional infections. Moreover, parasitological evidence enabled us to determine the purpose of the cubical perforated stone artifacts (stone toilet seats rather than cultic objects as currently debated).

Soil-transmitted helminth infections rank among the most important neglected tropical diseases in terms of morbidity, and almost one billion people are still infected with at least one species. While anthelmintic drugs are available, they do not offer long term protection against reinfection, precipitating the need for vaccines that provide long-term immunologic defense. Vaccine discovery and development is in advanced clinical development for hookworm infection, with a bivalent human hookworm vaccine in clinical trials in Brazil and Africa, but is in its infancy for both roundworm (ascariasis) and whipworm (trichuriasis) infections. One of the greatest hurdles to developing soil-transmitted helminth vaccines is the potent immunoregulatory properties of these helminths, creating a barrier to the induction of meaningful long-term protective immunity. While challenging for vaccinologists, this phenomenon presents unique opportunities to develop an entirely new class of anti-inflammatory drugs that capitalise on these immunomodulatory strategies. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials employing experimental soil-transmitted helminth challenge models, when coupled with findings from animal models, show that at least some soil-transmitted helminth-derived molecules can protect against the onset of autoimmune, allergic and metabolic disorders, and several natural products with the desired bioactivity have been isolated and tested in pre-clinical settings.

The systematic review was conducted in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines following a published protocol. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of STH infection, and meta-regression analysis was used to quantify associations with study characteristics. Where comparative data were available, sub-group analysis was conducted to evaluate the risk of STH infection in minority indigenous people relative to other population groups. The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated visually using Forest plots and was assessed quantitatively by the index of heterogeneity (I2) and Cochran Q-statistics.

Similarly, this could be a plausible explanation for the higher frequency and abundance of whipworms than roundworms, when other hypotheses are unsupported.", "keywords": ["Ascariasis", "Eggs", "Helminthes", "Resistance", "Tricuriasis"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.106229"}

Although most microbiota research focuses on the variation of single gut components, the crosstalk between components is still poorly characterized, especially in hosts living under natural conditions. We investigated the gut micro-biodiversity (bacteria, fungi and helminths) of 158 individuals of two wild non-human primates, the Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) and the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus). These species have contrasting diets and lifestyles, but live sympatrically in both human-impacted and pristine forests in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. Using non-invasive faecal pellets, helminths were identified using standard microscopy while bacteria and fungi were characterized by sequencing the V1-V3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and the ITS1-ITS2 fragment for fungi. Our results show that both diversity and composition of bacteria and fungi are associated with variation in helminth presence. Although interactions differed by habitat type, in both primates we found that Strongyloides was negatively associated and Trichuris was positively associated with bacterial and fungal richness. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies demonstrating an interaction between helminth and gut microbiota communities in wild non-human primates.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-01145-1"}

Studies conducted between 2000 and 2018 were searched from PubMed, Google Scholar, and local journals for systematic reviews and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guideline and checklists. Eligible studies were selected based on preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale in meta-analysis. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I 2 test statistics based on the random effect model. Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA 2.0) was used to calculate the pooled prevalence, and metaregression was run to assess the trend of parasite prevalence over time. Thirty-eight studies recruiting 16,266 participants were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of intestinal parasites was 52.0% (95% CI: 44.4-59.5). Amhara region was with the highest prevalence (60.3%; 95% CI: 50.1-69.6).

Some regions are reaching WHO goals, but transmission could rebound if strategies are discontinued without an epidemiological evaluation. For that, sensitive diagnostic methods to detect low intensity infections and localization of ongoing transmission are crucial. In this work, we estimated and compared the STH infection as obtained by different diagnostic methods in a low intensity setting. We conducted a cross-sectional study enrolling 792 participants from a district in Mozambique. Two stool samples from two consecutive days were collected from each participant. Samples were analysed by Telemann, Kato-Katz and qPCR for STH detection. We evaluated diagnostic sensitivity using a composite reference standard. By geostatistical methods, we estimated neighbourhood prevalence of at least one STH infection for each diagnostic method. We used environmental, demographical and socioeconomical indicators to account for any existing spatial heterogeneity in infection. qPCR was the most sensitive technique compared to composite reference standard: 92% (CI: 83%- 97%) for A. lumbricoides, 95% (CI: 88%- 98%) for T. trichiura and 95% (CI: 91%- 97%) for hookworm. qPCR also estimated the highest neighbourhood prevalences for at least one STH infection in a low intensity setting. While 10% of the neighbourhoods showed a prevalence above 20% when estimating with single Kato-Katz from one stool and Telemann from one stool, 86% of the neighbourhoods had a prevalence above 20% when estimating with qPCR. In low intensity settings, STH estimated prevalence of infection may be underestimated if based on Kato-Katz. qPCR diagnosis outperformed the microscopy methods. Thus, implementation of qPCR based predictive maps at STH control and elimination programmes would disclose hidden transmission and facilitate targeted interventions for transmission interruption.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0009803"}

For this STH, the proportion of participants with a satisfactory response (ERRi \u226550%), was 65% in Ethiopia, 61% in Lao PDR but only 29% in Pemba Island. There was a significant correlation between ERRi and infection intensity prior to drug administration (ERRi decreasing as a function of increasing infection intensity). Individual age and sex also affected the drug response, but these were of negligible clinical significance and not consistent across STHs and study sites. We found decreased efficacy of ALB against all the STHs analyzed in Pemba Island (Tanzania), an area with high drug pressure. This does not indicate causality, as this association may also be partially explained by differences in infection intensity prior to drug administration. Notwithstanding, our results indicate that without alternative treatment regimens, program targets will not be achievable on Pemba Island because of inadequate efficacy of ALB.

Given the low efficacy of these drugs against trichuriasis, investigation of drug combinations including moxidectin and ivermectin has recently been initiated, yet the identification of the best treatment option requires more research. We present the protocol for a trial investigating the efficacy and safety of co-administered moxidectin and albendazole compared to co-administered ivermectin and albendazole against Trichuris trichiura. Methods: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial enrolling 540 T. trichiura-infected adolescents aged 12-19 years on Pemba Island (Tanzania). The trial will be open-label with blinded outcome assessors. The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of orally co-administered single-dose moxidectin (8 mg)/albendazole (400 mg) compared to orally co-administered single-dose ivermectin (200 \u00b5g/kg)/albendazole (400 mg) in terms of egg reduction rates (ERRs) against T. trichiura infections assessed by Kato-Katz at 14-21 days post-treatment. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the drug combinations' superiority compared to their respective monotherapies, of the cure rates (CRs) against T. trichiura, and the safety and tolerability of all treatments, as well as CRs and ERRs against concomitant STH infections ( Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm). Potential effects of the treatment regimens on follow-up prevalences of STH at 5-6 weeks and 3 months post-treatment and pharmacokinetic/\u00a0 pharmacodynamic parameters will also be assessed. Conclusions: Results from this trial will help to inform decision- and policymakers on which anthelminthic combination therapy might improve existing deworming programs and provide a valuable adjunct tool for interrupting STH transmission.

To facilitate oxfendazole dose optimization for its use in patient populations, the relationship among oxfendazole dose, pharmacokinetics, and hemoglobin concentration was quantitatively characterized using population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. In fasting subjects, oxfendazole pharmacokinetics was well described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The change in oxfendazole pharmacokinetics when administered following a fatty meal was captured by an absorption model with one transit compartment and increased bioavailability. The effect of oxfendazole exposure on hemoglobin concentration in healthy adults was characterized by a life span indirect response model in which oxfendazole has positive but minor inhibitory effect on red blood cell synthesis. Further simulation indicated that oxfendazole has a low risk of posing a safety concern regarding hemoglobin concentration, even at a high oxfendazole dose of 60\u2009mg/kg of body weight once daily. The final model was further used to perform comprehensive target attainment simulations for whipworm infection and filariasis at various dose regimens and target attainment criteria.

Fasciola spp. and Paramphistomum spp. were 67 (20.30%) and 81 (24.55%), respectively. Most of the positive fecal samples were infected with the double infection which has the highest prevalence rate of about 40.24%, followed by single, three, and 4-5 types of parasites 30.63, 16.82, and 7.21%, respectively. This study suggests that Kalasin Province is highly endemic for GI parasites and this area may be an important source for an outbreak. Therefore, every household should deworm its cattle and eliminate and control snails as intermediate hosts. Findings from this study provide information that will assist in improving the cattle in Kalasin Province for better production and higher profitability.", "keywords": ["cattle", "gastrointestinal parasites", "prevalence"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.14202/vetworld.2021.2091-2096"}

In veterinary science, benzimidazole resistance has been mainly associated with three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the isotype-1 \u03b2-tubulin gene. In this study, we optimized the stool sample processing methodology and resistance allele frequency assessment in Trichuris trichiura and Necator americanus anthelmintic-related SNPs by pyrosequencing, and standardized it for large-scale benzimidazole efficacy screening use. Three different protocols for stool sample processing were compared in 19 T. trichiura-positive samples: fresh stool, egg concentration using metallic sieves with decreasing pore size, and egg concentration followed by flotation with saturated salt solution. Yield of each protocol was assessed by estimating the load of parasite DNA by real-time PCR. Then, we sequenced a DNA fragment of the \u03b2-tubulin gene containing the putative benzimidazole resistance SNPs in T. trichiura and N. americanus. Afterwards, resistant and susceptible-type plasmids were produced and mixed at different proportions, simulating different resistance levels. These mixtures were used to compare previously described pyrosequencing assays with processes newly designed by our own group. Once the stool sample processing and the pyrosequencing methodology was defined, the utility of the protocols was assessed by measuring the frequencies of putative resistance SNPs in 15 T. trichiura- and 15 N. americanus-positive stool samples. The highest DNA load was provided by egg concentration using metallic sieves with decreasing pore size. Sequencing information of the \u03b2-tubulin gene in Mozambican specimens was highly similar to the sequences previously reported, for T. trichiura and N. americanus, despite the origin of the sample. When we compared pyrosequencing assays using plasmids constructs, primers designed in this study provided the most accurate SNP frequencies. When pooled egg samples were analysed, none of resistant SNPs were observed in T. trichiura, whereas 17% of the resistant SNPs at codon 198 were found in one N. americanus sample. We optimized the sample processing methodology and standardized pyrosequencing in soil-transmitted helminth (STH) pooled eggs.

Our main objectives were to update knowledge on the composition of gastrointestinal helminths in wild canids from Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, and to describe differences in parasite prevalence and diversity among canid species and regions. Hunters and trappers provided whole carcasses of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) (N\u00a0=\u00a0176), and intestinal tracts of coyotes (Canis latrans) (N\u00a0=\u00a077) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) (N\u00a0=\u00a023) harvested for non-research purposes over the winter of 2016-2017. A modified Stoll's centrifugation sucrose flotation on feces of 250 wild canids was used, and eggs of one family and eight genera of parasitic helminths were recovered: diphyllobothriids, Taenia/Echinococcus spp., Capillaria spp., Toxascaris sp., Toxocara sp., Trichuris sp., Uncinaria sp., and Metorchis sp. Adult Taenia spp. cestodes were recovered from 61 of 276 (22%) canids.

Visual reading of Kato-Katz preparations requires the samples to be analyzed in a short period of time since its preparation. Digitizing the samples could provide a solution which allows to store the samples in a digital database and perform remote analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on digitized samples can support diagnosis by performing an objective and automatic quantification of disease infection. In this work, we propose an end-to-end pipeline for microscopy image digitization and automatic analysis of digitized images of STH. Our solution includes (a) a digitization system based on a mobile app that digitizes microscope samples using a 3D printed microscope adapter, (b) a telemedicine platform for remote analysis and labelling, and (c) novel deep learning algorithms for automatic assessment and quantification of parasitological infections by STH. The deep learning algorithm has been trained and tested on 51 slides of stool samples containing 949 Trichuris spp. eggs from 6 different subjects. The algorithm evaluation was performed using a cross-validation strategy, obtaining a mean precision of 98.44% and a mean recall of 80.94%. The results also proved the potential of generalization capability of the method at identifying different types of helminth eggs. Additionally, the AI-assisted quantification of STH based on digitized samples has been compared to the one performed using conventional microscopy, showing a good agreement between measurements. In conclusion, this work has presented a comprehensive pipeline using smartphone-assisted microscopy.

Eosinophils were present at significantly higher proportions in the spleen and bone marrow of wild mice compared with laboratory mice. Strikingly, the majority of eosinophils of wild mice exhibited a unique Ly6Ghi phenotype seldom described in laboratory literature. Ly6G expression correlated with activation status in spleen and bone marrow, but not peritoneal exudate cells, and is therefore likely not an activation marker per se. Intermediate Ly6G expression was transiently induced in a small proportion of eosinophils from C57BL/6 laboratory mice during acute infection with the whipworm Trichuris muris, but not during low-dose chronic infection, which better represents parasite exposure in the wild. We conclude that the natural state of the eosinophil is not adequately reflected in the standard laboratory mouse, which compromises our attempts to dissect their functional relevance.

In this study, we used the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) as a model system to investigate how the hosts' sex, age, exploration behavior, and viral infection history affects their infection risk, parasitic load, and community structure of gastrointestinal helminths. We hypothesized that the hosts' exploration behavior would play a key role in the risk for infection by different gastrointestinal helminths, whereby highly explorative individuals would have a higher infection risk leading to a wider diversity of helminths and a larger load compared to less explorative individuals. Fieldwork was performed in Morogoro, Tanzania, where we trapped a total of 214 individual mice. Their exploratory behavior was characterized using a hole-board test after which we collected the helminths inside their gastrointestinal tract.

This report suggests the efficacy of a genetic analysis for identifying infection sources.", "keywords": ["Colonoscopy", "Genetic analysis", "Trichuriasis", "Trichuris trichiura", "Zoonosis"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.2169/internalmedicine.8012-21"}

We examined a total of 21 soil samples from a toilet-like structure at the Hwajisan site, a Baekje-period royal villa, in present-day Korea. At least 4 species of helminth eggs, i.e., Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Clonorchis sinensis, and Trichuris sp. (or Trichuris vulpis) were detected in 3 sediment samples of the structure that was likely a toilet used by Baekje nobles. The eggs of T. trichiura were found in all 3 samples (no. 1, 4, and 5); and A. lumbricoides eggs were detected in 2 samples (no. 4 and 5). C. sinensis and T. vulpis-like eggs were found in no. 5 sample. From the findings of this study, we can suppose that the soil-transmitted helminths were prevalent in ancient Korean people, including the nobles of Baekje Kingdom during the 5th to 7th century.", "keywords": ["Ascaris lumbricoides", "Baekje", "Clonorchis sinensis", "Trichuris trichiura", "ancient kingdom", "flush toilet", "paleoparasitology", "parasite egg"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3347/kjp.2021.59.4.393"}
