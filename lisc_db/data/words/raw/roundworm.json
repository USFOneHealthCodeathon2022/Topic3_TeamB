Pregnant women are among at risk groups for the infection of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). STHs are highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries due to the deprived environmental sanitation and personal hygiene. Eating soil (geophagia) is also commonly practiced by pregnant women, particularly in developing countries. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of STHs and geophagia, and to assess associated factors among pregnant women in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia. A cross sectional study was conducted among 407 pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) at different health facilities located in Jimma Town. Data related to sociodemographic and geophagia practice was collected using a structured questionnaire and STH infections status was determined by using McMaster technique. A total of 407 pregnant women were included in this study. The overall prevalence of any STHs was 19.7% (80/407). Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent 45(56.2%), followed by Trichuris trichiura 19(23.8%) and hookworms 12(15%). There were 4(5%) of double infection with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Overall, 71 (17.4%) of the pregnant women responded to practice geophagia. STHs infection was significantly higher among geophagic pregnant women (p<0.01) and pregnant women who practiced geophagia were 3 times more likely (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-4.2) to have the STHs compared to non-geophagic. Out of those who claimed soil eating habits, 59.1% preferred reddish soil type. Geophagia practice was significantly higher during the third trimester as compared to first and second (p<0.05). Geophagia is a risky behavior and this study showed a significant association of geophagia practice with STH infections, although the causal relation could not be established.", "keywords": ["Ethiopia", "Geophagia", "Jimma", "Pregnant women", "STHs"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.4314/ejhs.v31i5.16"}

EM studies have mapped anatomical connectomes of many C.\u00a0elegans animals, highlighting the level of stereotypy in the anatomical network. Brain-wide calcium imaging and studies of specified neural circuits have uncovered striking flexibility in the functional coupling of neurons. The coupling between neurons is controlled by neuromodulators that act over long timescales. This gives rise to persistent behavioral states that animals switch between, allowing them to generate adaptive behavioral responses across environmental conditions. Thus, the dynamic coupling of neurons enables multiple behavioral states to be encoded in a physically stereotyped connectome.", "keywords": [], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1016/j.conb.2021.12.002"}

In 2015, a telephone questionnaire was conducted in order to elicit Scottish sheep farmers' attitudes and behaviours regarding the SCOPS recommended practices, as well as gauging farmers' general attitudes to gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN; term roundworm used in questionnaire) control. A quantitative structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was employed to determine the influences of socio-psychological factors and the uptake of individual anthelmintic resistance mitigating practices including: the implementation of a quarantine strategy for parasite control and the use of parasite diagnostic testing for monitoring faecal egg counts (FEC) and detecting AR. The proposed models established a good fit with the observed data and explained 61%, 54% and 27% of the variance in the adoption of AR testing, FEC monitoring, and quarantine behaviours respectively. The results presented highlight a number of consistent and distinct factors significantly influencing the implementation of selected SCOPS recommended practices. The negative influences of topography and farmer experience was frequently demonstrated in relation to multiple GIN control practices, as well as the positive influences of social norms, worm control knowledge, AR risk perception and positive attitudes to the services provided by the veterinary profession. Factors that were shown to have the greatest relative effects on individual parasite control practices included: the perceived expectation of others (i.e. Social norms) for implementing a quarantine strategy, farmer's suspicions to the presence of AR on the holding for instigating AR testing and the confirmation of AR for adopting FEC monitoring.

Our current study sought to establish the risk factors and burden of co-infection with S. haematobium, STH, and Plasmodium sp. among WRA in Kwale County, Coastal Kenya. A total of 534 WRA between the ages of 15-50 were enrolled in this cross-sectional study from four villages; Bilashaka and Mwaluphamba in Matuga sub-County, and Mwachinga and Dumbule in Kinango sub-County. Socio-demographic information was collected using a pre-tested standardized questionnaire. Parasitological examination was done using urine filtration method for Schistosoma haematobium, Kato Katz for STH (Ascaris lumbricoides, Hookworm, Trichuris trichiura), and standard slide microscopy for Plasmodium sp. Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA version 15.1. The overall prevalence of S. haematobium was 3.8% (95% CI: 2.6-5.4) while that for malaria was 4.9% (95% CI: 2.0-11.7). The prevalence of STH was 5.6% (95% CI: 2.8-11.3) with overall prevalence of 5.3% (95% CI: 2.5-10.9) for hookworm and 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2-1.9) for T. trichiura.

Between October 2018 and February 2020, stool and blood samples were collected every four months from school children (4 to 6 years of age). Stool samples were analyzed by duplicate Kato-Katz to assess the presence and intensity of any STH infection. Plasma Ab-responses against the total extract of Ascaris suum lung third stage larvae were measured through in-house Ab-ELISA's for seven different Ab-isotypes. At baseline, 42.4% of the 66 children were excreting eggs of any STH, Trichuris (37.9%) being the most prevalent. The cumulative prevalence (proportion of children tested that positive at least once over the entire study period) was 56.1% for Trichuris and 31.8% for Ascaris. For Ascaris, re-infections were frequently observed, whereas for Trichuris, children often remained excreting eggs following drug administration. When measuring anti-Ascaris Ab-levels, the cumulative seroprevalence was generally higher (IgG4: 60.6%; IgG1: 50.0%; IgE: 36.4%). The individual anti-Ascaris IgG4 levels at baseline were positively associated with the fecal egg counts averaged over the study period, the rate of egg-appearance and the number of positive test results. There was no apparent cross-reactivity between the anti-Ascaris IgG4 Ab-ELISA and Trichuris. We demonstrate that the children are exposed to STH before the age of four and that the exposure to Ascaris is underestimated when measured with copromicroscopy. Compared to other Ab-isotypes, IgG4 is the Ab-isotype of choice to measure Ascaris exposure in STH endemic settings. Finally, the results also highlight that measuring anti-Ascaris IgG4 levels holds promise as a tool to identify individuals at higher risk for continued exposure to this STH.", "keywords": [], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0010131"}

We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial, in schoolchildren, aged 9-10 years, across 40 schools over one year. Schools were randomly assigned either to the \"Magic Glasses Philippines\" health education intervention package (consisting of a cartoon video, classroom discussions, drawing and essay competition) complementing the standard health education activities of the Philippines Departments of Health and Education, or to a control group, which involved only the standard health education activities. The primary trial outcomes were the proportion of STH infected schoolchildren and their knowledge, attitude and behaviour of STH assessed in both groups at baseline and through two follow-up surveys undertaken immediately prior to the semi-annual national mass administration of albendazole. The outcomes between the study arms were compared using generalized estimating equation models, accounting for clustering at the school level.

However, chemotherapy alone is not efficient due to the high re-infection rate for people who live in the endemic area. The development of a vaccine that reduces the intensity of infection and maintains lower morbidity should be the primary target for infection control. Previously, our group demonstrated that immunization with crude Ascaris antigens in mice induced an IgG-mediated protective response with significant worm reduction. Here, we aimed to develop a multipeptide chimera vaccine based on conserved B-cell epitopes predicted from 17 common helminth proteomes using a bioinformatics algorithm. More than 480 B-cell epitopes were identified that are conserved in all 17 helminths. The Ascaris-specific epitopes were selected based on their reactivity to the pooled sera of mice immunized with Ascaris crude antigens or infected three times with A. suum infective eggs. The top 35 peptides with the strongest reactivity to Ascaris immune serum were selected to construct a chimeric antigen connected in sequence based on conformation. This chimera, called ASCVac-1, was produced as a soluble recombinant protein in an Escherichia coli expression system and, formulated with MPLA, was used to immunize mice. Mice immunized with ASCVac-1/MPLA showed around 50% reduced larvae production in the lungs after being challenged with A. suum infective eggs, along with significantly reduced inflammation and lung tissue/function damage. The reduced parasite count and pathology in infected lungs were associated with strong Th2 immune responses characterized by the high titers of antigen-specific IgG and its subclasses (IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3) in the sera and significantly increased IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 levels in lung tissues. The reduced IL-33 titers and stimulated eosinophils were also observed in lung tissues and may also contribute to the ASCVac-1-induced protection. Taken together, the preclinical trial with ASCVac-1 chimera in a mouse model demonstrated its significant vaccine efficacy associated with strong IgG-based Th2 responses, without IgE induction, thus reducing the risk of an allergic response. All results suggest that the multiepitope-based ASCVac-1 chimera is a promising vaccine candidate against Ascaris sp. infections.", "keywords": ["ascariasis", "chimera", "epitopes", "vaccine", "vaccinology"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2021.788185"}

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminths and associated factors among adolescents and adults in Bibugn Woreda, East Gojjam, Northwest Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Bibugn Woreda from February to September 2021. Using multistage proportionate sampling technique, 641 adolescents and adults were enrolled in this study. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and factors associated with helminthic infections was collected using structured questionnaire prepared in Amharic and administered through face-to-face interview. Parasite detection in stool samples was performed using modified formol-ether concentration and Kato-Katz techniques following standard protocols. Data was entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 25. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with soil-transmitted helminths infections. P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The overall prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths infection was 20.9% (134/641). The most detected parasite was Ascaris lumbricoides (12.5%), followed by hookworm species (7.5%) and Trichuris trichiura (1.1%).

Antimicrobial therapy and percutaneous drainage are the treatments of choice, lowering the mortality caused by this infection. We report a case of a 3-year-old girl admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and a low-grade fever, with abdominal ultrasonography revealing a hepatic lesion.

After excluding other possible etiologies, the patient was tested for parasitic infections. IgE for Ascaris lumbricoides came slightly higher. In addition to empirical antibiotic treatment, the patient received albendazole and made an uneventful recovery, with the full remission of the abscesses and without the need for drainage. In certain cases, parasites such as Ascaris lumbricoides are capable of inducing a T helper 2 (Th2) dominated immune response, predisposing the host to eosinophilia, hyperIgE, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Early diagnosis and treatment in these cases may lead to less invasive therapy options in order to obtain a full recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case in the literature of a paediatric patient with parasite-induced liver abscesses, with extremely high IgE values, minimal symptomatology, that made a fast, full recovery without the need of drainage.", "keywords": ["Th2 response", "hepatic abscess", "immune system", "parasites"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3390/medicina57121322"}

Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using structured questionnaire. Stool samples were collected and examined using direct saline, formol ether concentration technique and modified acid fast staining. CD4+ T cell counts and viral load were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD FACS) and COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS TaqMan HI2CAP assay, respectively.

There are limited data on the efficacy of commonly used disinfectants and fecal fixatives for inactivating the eggs of STH. This work tested five disinfectants for surface cleanup, four storage temperature conditions, and six transport/storage fixatives, to inactivate eggs of three species of STH of animal origin (Ascaris suum \"roundworm,\" Trichuris vulpis \"whipworm\" and Ancylostoma caninum \"hookworm\") as surrogates for human STH.

IMPORTANCE This study systematically evaluates common laboratory disinfectants and storage conditions for their effectiveness in inactivating the infective stages of soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Animal-infecting proxy species were chosen to represent three major groups of STH that infect humans: roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms. Previously published work in this area typically focuses on a particular inactivation method, either for a single STH species, or on a subset of closely related species. Because prediagnostic fecal specimens must be regarded as potentially infectious with a mix of species, such information may be of limited utility in a working laboratory. We provide a straightforward summary of storage and disinfection methods that can achieve complete inactivation across a range of STH species, which represents a significant advance for clinical, veterinary and research laboratory biosafety.", "keywords": ["STH", "biosafety", "helminth", "inactivation", "nematode", "parasite"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1128/Spectrum.01828-21"}

To determine the most efficient way of propagating A. galli in young chickens an experiment with a 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 factorial design involving age of chicken at infection (day-old or 14 days old), immunosuppression (dexamethasone (DEX), cyclophosphamide (CY) or sham), infective egg dose (0, 100, 300 or 900 embryonated eggs/bird) and time of worm recovery after infection (8 or 10 weeks post-infection) was conducted. The experiment used a total of 384 layer cockerel chicks. Infection was delivered orally in 3 split doses over one week and immunosuppressants were administered by intramuscular injection concurrently with the infections. Body weight, excreta egg counts, intestinal worm count and worm establishment rate were assessed. The only sign of ascaridiosis noted was mild diarrhoea at the time of slaughter in some birds with a significant- positive association with worm count. Infection caused a significant dose dependent reduction in body weight in non-immunosuppressed birds but this effect was ameliorated by immunosuppression. Age at infection had no significant effect on the studied variables although both worm and egg counts were numerically higher in the day-old infected groups. Egg dose significantly influenced the prevalence of infection, worm establishment rate, worm egg production and mean worm count. The 300 and 900 egg doses resulted in significantly higher worm count and egg production than the 100 egg dose. A significant negative correlation was observed between egg dose and worm establishment rate indicating an inverse relationship. Immunosuppression with DEX, but not CY resulted in significantly higher mean worm burden than in control chickens with excreta egg counts also considerably higher in DEX treated birds. Our results suggest that trickle infection at day-old with infective doses of 300 eggs coupled with immunosuppression with DEX would provide the most efficient way to propagate A. galli worms in vivo, as using older birds or a higher egg dose did not provide any advantage.", "keywords": ["Ascaridia galli infection", "Chicken", "Dose response", "Immunosuppression", "Maintenance", "Nematode"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1016/j.vetpar.2021.109624"}

As such, this study aimed to characterize the prevalence of intestinal parasites in dogs visiting off-leash parks in the region using sucrose double centrifugation and Fecal Dx\u00ae tests. Additionally, data obtained via the sucrose double centrifugation method were used to evaluate the performance of the Fecal Dx\u00ae tests. Fecal samples were collected from 466 dogs aged \u22656\u00a0months from May to November 2018 (mean age\u00a0=\u00a03.7\u00a0years). Overall, eleven intestinal parasites were identified using sucrose double centrifugation. Roundworm eggs (Toxocara canis and Baylisascaris procyonis), hookworm eggs (Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria stenocephala), and whipworm eggs (Trichuris vulpis) were identified in 1.07% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-2.56%), 5.79% (95% CI 3.85-8.31%), and 5.15% (95% CI 3.33-7.57) of samples, respectively. Using the Fecal Dx\u00ae tests, 1.07% (95% CI 0.38-2.56%), 4.29% (95% CI 2.64-6.55%), and 2.15% (95% CI 1.03-3.91) of the samples tested positive for roundworm, hookworm, and whipworm antigen, respectively. To assess the level of agreement between the Fecal Dx\u00ae tests and sucrose double centrifugation, three methods were used. Cohen's kappa indicated a fair-to-moderate level of agreement between Fecal Dx\u00ae tests and sucrose double centrifugation. In contrast, the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa and Gwet's first-order agreement coefficient indicated almost perfect agreement between these tests, ranging from 0.87 to 0.99 among the parasites examined.

We studied the effects of coinfections on the antibody profile in a cohort of 715 Mozambican children and adults using the Luminex technology with a panel of 16 antigens from P. falciparum and 11 antigens from helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Schistosoma spp.) and measured antigen-specific IgG and total IgE responses. We compared the antibody profile between groups defined by P. falciparum and helminth previous exposure (based on serology) and/or current infection (determined by microscopy and/or qPCR). In multivariable regression models adjusted by demographic, socioeconomic, water, and sanitation variables, individuals exposed/infected with P. falciparum and helminths had significantly higher total IgE and antigen-specific IgG levels, magnitude (sum of all levels) and breadth of response to both types of parasites compared to individuals exposed/infected with only one type of parasite (P \u2264 0.05). There was a positive association between exposure/infection with P. falciparum and exposure/infection with helminths or the number of helminth species, and vice versa (P \u2264 0.001). In addition, children coexposed/coinfected tended (P = 0.062) to have higher P. falciparum parasitemia than those single exposed/infected.

We compared the antibody profile between groups of Mozambican individuals defined by P. falciparum and helminth previous exposure and/or current infection. Our results show a significant increase in antibody responses in individuals coexposed/coinfected with P. falciparum and helminths in comparison with individuals exposed/infected with only one of these parasites, and suggest that this increase is due to a more permissive immune environment to infection in the host. Importantly, this study takes previous exposure into account, which is particularly relevant in endemic areas where continuous infections imprint and shape the immune system.

Understanding the interactions between STHs and other pathogens can inform our understanding of human evolution and contemporary disease patterns. We worked with Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the Bolivian Amazon, where STHs are prevalent. We tested whether STHs and eosinophil levels-likely indicative of infection in this population-are associated with dampened immune responses to in vitro stimulation with H1N1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens. Whole blood samples (n\u2009=\u2009179) were treated with H1N1 vaccine and LPS and assayed for 13 cytokines (INF-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, GM-CSF and TNF-\u0251). We evaluated how STHs and eosinophil levels affected cytokine responses and T helper (Th) 1 and Th2-cytokine suite responses to stimulation. Infection with Ascaris lumbricoides was significantly (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) associated with lower response of some cytokines to H1N1 and LPS in women. Eosinophils were significantly negatively associated with some cytokine responses to H1N1 and LPS, with the strongest effects in women, and associated with a reduced Th1- and Th2-cytokine response to H1N1 and LPS in women and men. Consistent with the 'old friends' and hygiene hypotheses, we find that STHs were associated with dampened cytokine responses to certain viral and bacterial antigens. This suggests that STH infections may play an essential role in immune response regulation and that the lack of STH immune priming in industrialized populations may increase the risk of over-reactive immunity.

Repeated annual cross-sectional community surveys were conducted between 2013 and 2019 in individuals of 5 years and older. Primary outcome was the change of infection prevalence estimates from baseline to month 36 (12 months after the last treatment). After three rounds of annual MDA, Wuchereria bancrofti circulating filarial antigen (CFA) and microfilaria (Mf) prevalence estimates decreased from 19.7% to 4.3% and from 8.6% to 0%, respectively; after semiannual MDA, CFA and Mf prevalences decreased from 37.8% to 16.8% and 17.9% to 1%, respectively. Mixed effects logistic regression models indicated that the odds of having Mf decreased by 97% (P < 0.001) at month 36 (similar odds for annual and semiannual MDA zones). A parallel analysis showed that the odds of CFA were reduced by 83% and 69% at 36 months in the annual and semiannual treatment zones, respectively (P < 0.001). Onchocerca volvulus Mf prevalence decreased slightly after multiple MDA rounds in both treatment zones. Reductions in hookworm and Trichuris trichiura prevalences and intensities were slightly greater in the annual treatment zone. Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence rates were relatively unchanged, although infection intensities decreased sharply throughout. Results show that annual and semiannual MDA were equally effective for reducing LF and soil-transmitted helminth infection parameters over a 3-year period, and reductions recorded at month 36 were sustained by routine annual MDA through month 72.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.4269/ajtmh.21-0768"}

Objective To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography as compared to Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography. Method A prospective, analytical study was conducted in the Department of Radiodiagnosis and Imaging at Dhulikhel Hospital between October 2018 and December 2020. Altogether 100 patients of all ages with obstructive jaundice undergoing Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography and Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography were included. The causes of obstructive jaundice as identified by Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography were compared to that of Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography considering Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography as gold standard for the diagnosis. Result Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography revealed choledocholithiasis in 60 (60%) patients, benign stricture - 14(14%), malignant stricture-11(11%), periampullary carcinoma in 8(8%) and normal study in 4(4%) patients. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography showed choledocholithiasis in 59(59%) patients, strictures (benign in 13%, malignant in 10%), ascariasis in 3(3%) and normal findings in 5(5%) patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography in detecting choledocholithiasis were 96.6%, 92.3%, 95%, and 95%. The same values for benign strictures were 92.3%, 97.7%, 85.7% and 98.9%, whereas those for malignant strictures were 90.9%, 98.8%, 90.9% and 98.8%. All values were 100% for peri-ampullary carcinoma and ascariasis. Hence, Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography showed good accuracy for detecting causes of obstructive jaundice (p < 0.05) as compared to Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography. Conclusion Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography is an accurate, non-invasive technique in evaluation of obstructive jaundice and offers similar diagnostic value compared to Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": null}

The presence of various stages of worm development in the pulmonary and intestinal mucosae induces a humoral and cellular immune response. However, although there is much evidence of the protective role of mucosal immunity against various pathogens, including helminths, there is still a gap in the knowledge about the immune response and the mechanisms of action that are involved in protection against diseases, especially in the initial phase of ascariasis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the kinetic aspects of the immune parasitological parameters in intestinal and pulmonary mucosae in male mice with early ascariasis. Therefore, two mouse strains that showed different susceptibilities to ascariasis (BALB/c and C57BL/6J) when experimentally infected with 2,500 infective eggs of Ascaris suum from time point 0 were examined: the immune parasitological parameters were evaluated each 2 days after infection over a period of 12\u2009days. The results were suggestive of a synergetic action of intestinal and pulmonary secretory IgA (S-IgA) contributing to protection against early ascariasis by reducing the amount of migrating larvae as well as the influx of leukocytes in the lung and the consequent impairment of pulmonary capacity.", "keywords": ["experimental ascariasis", "helminth", "mucosal immunity", "pulmonary larval migration"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1128/IAI.00595-21"}

In 2015, a total of 20 survey sites were sampled in 10 counties (cities) of Yunnan Province using the stratified cluster random sampling method. Stool samples were collected from all local permanent residents at ages of one year and older in each survey site, and the soil-borne nematode eggs were identified using the modified Kato-Katz technique and the egg number was counted. In addition, the hookworm species was identified using the filter-paperculture method, and Enterobius vermicularis eggs were detected using the cellophane tape method in children at ages of 3 to 6 years. A total of 5 067 residents received stool examinations, and 950 residents were detected with soil-borne nematode infections, with an overall prevalence rate of 18.75%. The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichura and hookworm was 7.52%, 8.47% and 9.02%, respectively. Among 446 children detected using the cellophane tape method, 5 children were detected with E. vermicularis infections. Among the 160 residents with hookworm infections, there were 139 residents with Necator americanus infections (86.88%), 16 with A. duodenale infections (10.00%) and 5 with mixed infections (3.12%). Mild A. lumbricoides (67.98%, 259/381), T. trichura (88.58%, 380/429) and hookworm infections (94.53%, 432/457) were predominant. Among the four ecological zones, the highest prevalence of human soilborne nematode infections was found in the East Tibet-South Sichuan Ecological Zone (31.79%), and among the 10 survey counties (cities), the greatest prevalence was seen in Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County (50.13%), while the lowest prevalence was found in Ninglang Yi Autonomous County (0.40%). The prevalence of human soil-borne nematode infections was 5.67% (43/759), 26.67% (610/2 287) and 14.70% (297/2 021) in high-, moderate- and low-economic-level regions, respectively.

A crucial challenge to inferring the DFE from natural genetic variation is the sensitivity of the site frequency spectrum to factors like population size change, population substructure, genome structure, and nonrandom mating. Although inference methods aim to control for population size changes, the influence of nonrandom mating remains incompletely understood, despite being a common feature of many species. We report the DFE estimated from 326 genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode roundworm with a high rate of self-fertilization. We evaluate the robustness of DFE inferences using simulated data that mimics the genomic structure and reproductive life history of C. elegans. Our observations demonstrate how the combined influence of self-fertilization, genome structure, and natural selection on linked sites can conspire to compromise estimates of the DFE from extant polymorphisms with existing methods. These factors together tend to bias inferences toward weakly deleterious mutations, making it challenging to have full confidence in the inferred DFE of new mutations as deduced from standing genetic variation in species like C. elegans. Improved methods for inferring the DFE are needed to appropriately handle strong linked selection and selfing. These results highlight the importance of understanding the combined effects of processes that can bias our interpretations of evolution in natural populations.", "keywords": ["distribution of fitness effects", "linked selection", "mutation", "self-fertilization", "site frequency spectrum"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1093/genetics/iyab166"}

The initial phase of Ascaris infection is marked by larval migration from the host's organs, causing mechanical injuries followed by an intense local inflammatory response, which is characterized mainly by neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration, especially in the lungs. During the pulmonary phase, the lesions induced by larval migration and excessive immune responses contribute to tissue remodeling marked by fibrosis and lung dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the relationship between SIgA levels and eosinophils. We found that TLR2 and TLR4 signaling induces eosinophils and promotes SIgA production during Ascaris suum infection. Therefore, control of parasite burden during the pulmonary phase of ascariasis involves eosinophil influx and subsequent promotion of SIgA levels. In addition, we also demonstrate that eosinophils also participate in the process of tissue remodeling after lung injury caused by larval migration, contributing to pulmonary fibrosis and dysfunction in re-infected mice. In conclusion, we postulate that eosinophils play a central role in mediating host innate and humoral immune responses by controlling parasite burden, tissue inflammation, and remodeling during Ascaris suum infection. Furthermore, we suggest that the use of probiotics can induce eosinophilia and SIgA production and contribute to controlling parasite burden and morbidity of helminthic diseases with pulmonary cycles.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1010067"}

The presence of four intestinal parasite egg taxa was detected: Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), Taenia sp.

Findings reveal that intestinal parasitic diseases most likely caused by poor sanitary conditions were a human problem in the Late Iron Age of Israel, affecting even high-status groups. The study demonstrates the potential of archaeoparasitological investigations to expand our knowledge of the origin and history of regional infections. Moreover, parasitological evidence enabled us to determine the purpose of the cubical perforated stone artifacts (stone toilet seats rather than cultic objects as currently debated). The eggs of some parasite taxa are less durable, so may theoretically be absent due to selective preservation.

Soil-transmitted helminth infections rank among the most important neglected tropical diseases in terms of morbidity, and almost one billion people are still infected with at least one species. While anthelmintic drugs are available, they do not offer long term protection against reinfection, precipitating the need for vaccines that provide long-term immunologic defense. Vaccine discovery and development is in advanced clinical development for hookworm infection, with a bivalent human hookworm vaccine in clinical trials in Brazil and Africa, but is in its infancy for both roundworm (ascariasis) and whipworm (trichuriasis) infections. One of the greatest hurdles to developing soil-transmitted helminth vaccines is the potent immunoregulatory properties of these helminths, creating a barrier to the induction of meaningful long-term protective immunity. While challenging for vaccinologists, this phenomenon presents unique opportunities to develop an entirely new class of anti-inflammatory drugs that capitalise on these immunomodulatory strategies. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials employing experimental soil-transmitted helminth challenge models, when coupled with findings from animal models, show that at least some soil-transmitted helminth-derived molecules can protect against the onset of autoimmune, allergic and metabolic disorders, and several natural products with the desired bioactivity have been isolated and tested in pre-clinical settings.

This systematic review aimed to quantify the prevalence of STH infection within minority indigenous populations of the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines following a published protocol. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of STH infection, and meta-regression analysis was used to quantify associations with study characteristics. Where comparative data were available, sub-group analysis was conducted to evaluate the risk of STH infection in minority indigenous people relative to other population groups. The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated visually using Forest plots and was assessed quantitatively by the index of heterogeneity (I2) and Cochran Q-statistics. From 1,366 unique studies that were identified, 81 were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of infection within minority indigenous populations was 61.4% (95% CI 50.8, 71.4) for overall STH infection; 32.3% (95% CI 25.7, 39.3) for Ascaris.lumbricoides; 43.6% (95% CI 32.6, 54.8) for Trichuris.trichiura; 19.9% (95% CI 15.7, 24.5) for hookworm and 6.3% (95% CI 3.2, 10.2) for Strongyloides.stercoralis. A significant increase in T. trichiura prevalence was observed over time. The stratified analysis showed that the prevalence of infection for STH overall and for each STH species were not significantly different in minority indigenous participants compared to other populations groups. The prevalence of STH infection is high within minority indigenous populations across countries at very different levels of socio-economic development.

In light of the recent pandemic, the repurposing of IVM to combat SARS-CoV-2 has acquired significant attention. Recently, IVM has been proven effective in numerous in-silico and molecular biology experiments against the infection in mammalian cells and human cohort studies. One promising study had reported a marked reduction of 93% of released virion and 99.98% unreleased virion levels upon administration of IVM to Vero-hSLAM cells. IVM's mode of action centres around the inhibition of the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of viral proteins by disrupting the Importin heterodimer complex (IMP\u03b1/\u03b21) and downregulating STAT3, thereby effectively reducing the cytokine storm. Furthermore, the ability of IVM to block the active sites of viral 3CLpro and S protein, disrupts important machinery such as viral replication and attachment. This review compiles all the molecular evidence to date, in review of the antiviral characteristics exhibited by IVM. Thereafter, we discuss IVM's mechanism and highlight the clinical advantages that could potentially contribute towards disabling the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2.

The estimated population infected was 29.12 million (95% CI: 15.88 million-42.32 million) for all STH; 16.97 million (95% CI: 5.57 million-28.39 million) for hookworm infections; 8.83 million (95% CI: 3.18 million-14.45 million) for ascariasis; and 6.60 million (95% CI: 0.97 million-12.25 million) for trichuriasis. Overall, the prevalence of ascariasis and trichuriasis was relatively high in children, while hookworm infections were more common in the older population, especially those over 60. STH was highly prevalent in western China, and moderately in central areas, but low in eastern and northern regions. Out of 3,579 hookworm cases with species differentiation, 479 cases (13.38%) were infected with only Ancylostoma spp., 2,808 cases (78.46%) with only Necator americanus, and another 292 cases (8.16%) with both species. This survey demonstrated the continuous decrease of STH in rural China. However, endemicity still prevails in the western areas of the country. Hookworm, especially N. americanus, is becoming the predominant species. Older farmers in western China should be prioritized for control due to the high prevalence of hookworm.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0009710"}

However, due to the lack of large individual patient datasets collected using standardized protocols and the application of population-based statistical methods, little is known about factors that may affect individual responses to treatment. We re-analyzed 645 individual patient data from three standardized clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy of a single 400 mg oral dose of ALB against STHs in schoolchildren from different study sites, each with varying history of drug pressure based on duration of mass drug administration programs: Ethiopia, low; Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), moderate; Pemba Island (Tanzania), high. Using a Bayesian statistical modelling approach to estimate individual responses (individual egg reduction rates, ERRi), we found that efficacy was lower in Pemba Island, particularly for T. trichiura. For this STH, the proportion of participants with a satisfactory response (ERRi \u226550%), was 65% in Ethiopia, 61% in Lao PDR but only 29% in Pemba Island. There was a significant correlation between ERRi and infection intensity prior to drug administration (ERRi decreasing as a function of increasing infection intensity). Individual age and sex also affected the drug response, but these were of negligible clinical significance and not consistent across STHs and study sites. We found decreased efficacy of ALB against all the STHs analyzed in Pemba Island (Tanzania), an area with high drug pressure. This does not indicate causality, as this association may also be partially explained by differences in infection intensity prior to drug administration. Notwithstanding, our results indicate that without alternative treatment regimens, program targets will not be achievable on Pemba Island because of inadequate efficacy of ALB.

Three groups of six piglets each were infected orally (10,000 embryonated A. suum eggs) in a single dose (\"single infection\").

The Ussing chamber technique was applied for the functional characterization of small intestinal tissues [short-circuit currents (Isc) as induced by glucose, alanine and peptides; 3H-glucose net flux rates; tissue conductance (Gt)]. Transcription and expression levels of relevant cytokines and nutrient transporters were evaluated (qPCR/western blot). Peptide- and alanine-induced changes in Isc were significantly decreased in the jejunum and ileum of the trickle-infected group at 49 dpi and in the ileum of the single-infected group at 49 dpi. No significant differences regarding glucose transport were observed between the Ascaris-infected groups and the control group in Ussing chamber experiments. Transcription levels of the glucose and peptide transporters as well as of selected transcription factors (transcription of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 [STAT6] and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha [Hif-1\u03b1]) were significantly increased in response to both infection types after some periods.

Worms were chronically exposed to 50 mGy\u00b7h-1 external gamma ionizing radiations throughout different developmental periods (namely embryogenesis, gametogenesis, and full development). Then, in addition to reproduction parameters, we performed a wide analysis of lipids (different class and fatty acid via FAMES), which are both important signaling molecules for reproduction and molecular targets of oxidative stress. Our results showed that reproductive defects are life stage dependent, that lipids are differently misregulated according to the considered exposure (e.g., upon embryogenesis and full development) and do not fully explain radiation induced reproductive defects.

The periodic administration of single dose benzimidazoles (i.e., albendazole, mebendazole) to at-risk individuals in endemic regions is at the center of STH control strategies. Given the low efficacy of these drugs against trichuriasis, investigation of drug combinations including moxidectin and ivermectin has recently been initiated, yet the identification of the best treatment option requires more research. We present the protocol for a trial investigating the efficacy and safety of co-administered moxidectin and albendazole compared to co-administered ivermectin and albendazole against Trichuris trichiura. Methods: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial enrolling 540 T. trichiura-infected adolescents aged 12-19 years on Pemba Island (Tanzania). The trial will be open-label with blinded outcome assessors. The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of orally co-administered single-dose moxidectin (8 mg)/albendazole (400 mg) compared to orally co-administered single-dose ivermectin (200 \u00b5g/kg)/albendazole (400 mg) in terms of egg reduction rates (ERRs) against T. trichiura infections assessed by Kato-Katz at 14-21 days post-treatment. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the drug combinations' superiority compared to their respective monotherapies, of the cure rates (CRs) against T. trichiura, and the safety and tolerability of all treatments, as well as CRs and ERRs against concomitant STH infections ( Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm). Potential effects of the treatment regimens on follow-up prevalences of STH at 5-6 weeks and 3 months post-treatment and pharmacokinetic/\u00a0 pharmacodynamic parameters will also be assessed. Conclusions: Results from this trial will help to inform decision- and policymakers on which anthelminthic combination therapy might improve existing deworming programs and provide a valuable adjunct tool for interrupting STH transmission.

Stool samples collected in Fiji and preserved in potassium dichromate were transferred to Melbourne at ambient temperature. Samples were washed to remove potassium dichromate and DNA was extracted with the Mini-Beadbeater-24 and a column-based kit. A SYBR green qPCR to detect the vertebrate mitochondrial gene was used as a DNA extraction control. Samples were tested using a probe-based multiplex qPCR targeting A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and S. stercoralis, and in a second multiplex reaction to detect hookworms to the species level (A. duodenale, A. ceylanicum, N. americanus). An internal amplification control in both multiplex assays was included to prevent false-negative results due to PCR inhibitors. Samples were homogenised for a single cycle of 40 seconds to release STH DNA and washed stool was stored for up to 15 weeks at -30\u00b0C without compromising DNA. Our multiplex qPCR detected multiple species of STH without reduced sensitivity compared to singleplex. qPCR data from 40 stools was validated against STH-positive stools determined by microscopy.

A critical prerequisite to develop such systems is an understanding of the gene family encoding \u03b2-tubulin proteins, the principal targets of BZ drugs. First, the \u03b2-tubulin gene families of Ascaris lumbricoides and Ascaris suum were characterized through the analysis of published genomes. Second, RNA-seq and RT-PCR analyses on cDNA were applied to determine the transcription profiles of the different gene family members. The results revealed that Ascaris species have at least seven different \u03b2-tubulin genes of which two are highly expressed during the entire lifecycle. Third, deep amplicon sequencing was performed on these two genes in more than 200 adult A. lumbricoides (Ethiopia and Tanzania) and A. suum (Belgium) worms, to investigate the intra- and inter-species genetic diversity and the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with BZ resistance in other helminth species; F167Y (TTC>TAC or TTT>TAT), E198A (GAA>GCA or GAG>GCG), E198L (GAA>TTA) and F200Y (TTC>TAC or TTT>TAT). These particular SNPs were absent in the two investigated genes in all three Ascaris populations. This study demonstrated the presence of at least seven \u03b2-tubulin genes in Ascaris worms. A new nomenclature was proposed and prioritization of genes for future BZ resistance research was discussed. This is the first comprehensive description of the \u03b2-tubulin gene family in Ascaris and provides a framework to investigate the prevalence and potential role of \u03b2-tubulin sequence polymorphisms in BZ resistance in a more systematic manner than previously possible.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0009777"}

We found that gene families related to epidermal chitin synthesis and environmental information processes in the roundworm genome have expanded significantly. Furthermore, we demonstrated unique genes involved in essential amino acid metabolism in the B.\u00a0schroederi genome, inferred to be essential for the adaptation to the giant panda-specific diet. In addition, under different deworming pressures, we found that four resistance-related genes (glc-1, nrf-6, bre-4 and ced-7) were under strong positive selection in a captive population.

A cross-sectional study was undertaken in Gondar city, North West Ethiopia, from November 2019 to May 2020 to evaluate the prevalence and different related risk factors of chicken Ascaris and Heterakis infections. A total of 384 hens were tested utilizing the faecal flotation technique, with 170 native and 214 alien varieties. During the collection of faecal samples, the breed, age, production system, and feces consistency of chickens were all taken into account. One hundred seventy-one (44.5%) of the total (384) investigated feces tested positive for at least one of these parasite illnesses. The parasite's prevalence was influenced by age, breed, and the type of production technique used. A higher infection rate was observed in the younger (68.9%) indigenous (67.1%) chickens reared under the extensive production system (46.9%). The prevalence of ascariasis and heterakiasis was nearly half percent in this study, even though the study was conducted in dry season, which is relatively unfavorable to parasites living in the environment and it specified only on the two common chicken ascaris nematodes.

P granules are RNA-rich protein condensates that share the key properties of liquid droplets such as a spherical shape, the ability to fuse, and fast diffusion of their molecular components. An outstanding question is to what extent phase separation at thermodynamic equilibrium is appropriate to describe the formation of condensates in an active cellular environment. To address this question, we investigate the response of P granule condensates in living cells to temperature changes. We observe that P granules dissolve upon increasing the temperature and recondense upon lowering the temperature in a reversible manner. Strikingly, this temperature response can be captured by in vivo phase diagrams that are well described by a Flory-Huggins model at thermodynamic equilibrium. This finding is surprising due to active processes in a living cell. To address the impact of such active processes on intracellular phase separation, we discuss temperature heterogeneities. We show that, for typical estimates of the density of active processes, temperature represents a well-defined variable and that mesoscopic volume elements are at local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our findings provide strong evidence that P granule assembly and disassembly are governed by phase separation based on local thermal equilibria where the nonequilibrium nature of the cytoplasm is manifested on larger scales.", "keywords": ["P granules", "in vivo phase diagram", "phase separation", "temperature"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2102772118"}

Genomic and anatomical lines of evidence, including expansion and positive selection of genes related to the cuticle and basal metabolisms, indicated that B. schroederi undergoes specific adaptations to survive in the sharp-edged bamboo enriched gut of giant pandas by structurally increasing its cuticle thickness and efficiently utilizing host nutrients through gut parasitism. Additionally, we characterized the secretome of B. schroederi and predicted potential drug and vaccine targets for new control strategies.
