XGBoost software was used, a very popular ML model, to fit and analyze the data. The Python SHAP library was used to understand the importance in the trained model, of the variables for predictions. The description of the contribution of these variables on a particular prediction was obtained, using different types of plot methods. The results show that the ML models are superior to the classical statistical models; not only demonstrating similar results but also explaining, by using the SHAP package, the influence and interactions between the variables in the generated models.

Previous approaches to mapping predation risk across a landscape quantify predator space use to estimate potential predator-prey encounters, yet this approach does not account for successful predator attack resulting in prey mortality. An exception is a prey kill site that reflects an encounter resulting in mortality, but obtaining information on kill sites is expensive and requires time to accumulate adequate sample sizes.We illustrate an alternative approach using predator scat locations and their contents to quantify spatial predation risk for elk (Cervus canadensis) from multiple predators in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We surveyed over 1300\u00a0km to detect scats of bears (Ursus arctos/U. americanus), cougars (Puma concolor), coyotes (Canis latrans), and wolves (C. lupus). To derive spatial predation risk, we combined predictions of scat-based resource selection functions (RSFs) weighted by predator abundance with predictions that a predator-specific scat in a location contained elk. We evaluated the scat-based predictions of predation risk by correlating them to predictions based on elk kill sites. We also compared scat-based predation risk on summer ranges of elk following three migratory tactics for consistency with telemetry-based metrics of predation risk and cause-specific mortality of elk.We found a strong correlation between the scat-based approach presented here and predation risk predicted by kill sites and (r\u00a0=\u00a0.98, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Elk migrating east of the Ya Ha Tinda winter range were exposed to the highest predation risk from cougars, resident elk summering on the Ya Ha Tinda winter range were exposed to the highest predation risk from wolves and coyotes, and elk migrating west to summer in Banff National Park were exposed to highest risk of encountering bears, but it was less likely to find elk in bear scats than in other areas. These patterns were consistent with previous estimates of spatial risk based on telemetry of collared predators and recent cause-specific mortality patterns in elk.A scat-based approach can provide a cost-efficient alternative to kill sites of quantifying broad-scale, spatial patterns in risk of predation for prey particularly in multiple predator species systems.", "keywords": ["Cervus canadensis", "detection dog", "elk", "resource selection functions", "scat analysis", "spatial predation risk"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1002/ece3.8589"}

PFAS are regularly detected in surface waters, but their effects on many aquatic organisms are still poorly understood. Species with thyroid-dependent development, like amphibians, can be especially susceptible to PFAS effects on thyroid hormone regulation. We examined sublethal effects of aquatic exposure to four commonly detected PFAS on larval northern leopard frogs (Rana [Lithobates] pipiens), American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), and eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum). Animals were exposed for 30 days (frogs and salamanders) or until metamorphosis (toads) to 10, 100, or 1,000 \u03bcg/L of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), or 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). We determined that chronic exposure to common PFAS can negatively affect amphibian body condition and development at concentrations as low as 10 \u03bcg/L. These effects were highly species-dependent, with species having prolonged larval development (frogs and salamanders) being more sensitive to PFAS than more rapidly developing species (toads). Our results demonstrate some species could experience sublethal effects at sites with surface waters highly affected by PFAS. Our results also indicate that evaluating PFAS toxicity using a single species is not sufficient for accurate amphibian risk assessment. Future studies are needed to determine whether these differences in susceptibility can be predicted from species life histories and determine whether more commonly occurring environmental levels of PFAS could affect amphibians.

Clearance and volume parameters were scaled to body size (weight for albendazole and height for albendazole sulfoxide and sulfone). Dose proportionality was observed for the active metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, but only in hookworm-infected individuals, with increasing exposure resulting in increased ERR. Exposure of sulfoxide was lowest in the tallest individuals. Pharmacometric simulations indicate that doses up to 800\u2005mg could further increase albendazole efficacy in hookworm-infected adults, whereas the standard dose of 400\u2005mg is sufficient in the youngest age cohorts.

In this study, the role of Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress in L. vannamei was determined by its effect on relevant gene expression and enzymatic activity. Nrf2 was cloned and analyzed. Results revealed that Nrf2 contains a 1575 bp open reading frame encoding 524 amino acids and a conserved bZIP Maf domain. The sequence similarity of Nrf2 between L. vannamei and Homarus americanus is 81%. Although the Nrf2 expression was detected in all tissues, the Nrf2 expression levels were the highest in the hepatopancreas, followed by the eyestalk and muscle. RNA interference significantly decreased the expression of antioxidant-related genes (SOD, GPX, CAT, Trx, and HO-1; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), significantly upregulated the expression of autophagy genes (Atg3, Atg4, Atg5, Atg10, and Atg12; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and apoptosis genes (Caspase-3 and P53; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, SOD, CAT, and GPX enzyme activities decreased whereas the MDA activity increased. The histological results of the shrimp injected with dsRNA-Nrf2 showed that the hepatic tubules were irregularly arranged, the lumen was abnormal, and a few hepatic tubules were significantly enlarged compared with those of the dsRNA-EGFP group. The hepatocytes were also vacuolated. In conclusion, this study provided evidence that Nrf2 is involved in the regulation of antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy in shrimp.", "keywords": ["Antioxidant capacity", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Litopenaeus vannamei", "Nrf2", "RNA interference"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1016/j.fsi.2022.02.010"}

Supplementation doubled over-winter survival with the largest effects occurring in the late increase phase. Although the proximate cause of mortality was predation, supplemented hares significantly decreased foraging time and selected for conifer habitat, potentially reducing their predation risk. Supplemented hares also lost less body mass which resulted in the production of larger leverets.

After long-term mass distribution for onchocerciasis, ivermectin is expected to have additional benefits beyond the envisioned targets by reducing the burden of other co-endemic parasitic infections as to STHs. To date, studies focused on the collateral impact of CDTi on STH in Ethiopia are scanty. Two community-based cross-sectional surveys (baseline in 1997 and post-CDTi in 2017) were conducted to evaluate the impact of long-term CDTi employed to control and eliminate onchocerciasis on the burden of STH infections in Yeki district of southwest Ethiopia. Stool samples were collected and examined using Ritchie`s concentration and Kato-Katz techniques in the baseline and current study, respectively. Overall, 188(38.3%, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 34.1-42.7%) individuals were positive at least for any of the STH species from 491 study participants in the post-CDTi. The prevalence of A. lumbricoides, hookworms, and T. trichiura was 11.2% (95% CI 8.7-14.3%), 16.3% (95% CI 13.3-19.8%), and 29.9% (95% CI 26.1-34.1%), respectively. Individuals aged 5-9 years had a significantly higher prevalence of A. lumbricoides (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6.5, 95% CI 1.7-25.4), T. trichuria (AOR 8, 95% CI 2.6-25.1), and any STH infection (AOR 5, 95% CI 1.7-14.7) than those of \u2265 51 years. Also, significantly higher prevalences of T. trichuria infection were observed in individuals aged 10-14 years (AOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-9.9), 15-20 years (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.1), 21-30 years (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.5), and 31-40 years (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-7.5) compared with those of \u2265 51 years. The prevalence of A. lumbricoides was significantly higher in males (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9). Of the 491 study participants, only data from 400 individuals who had not been involved in a mass drug administration (MDA) with other STH anthelmintics were considered in the comparative analysis. Before CDTi, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, hookworm, and any STH infection was 47.1% (95% CI 41.6-52.7%), 3.3% (95% CI 1.8-5.9%), 37.9% (95% CI 32.7-43.5%), and 58.8% (95% CI 53.2-64.1%), respectively. Long-term CDTi considerably reduced the prevalences of A. lumbricoides and hookworm by 76.2% and 56.9%, respectively (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, CDTi did not affect the prevalence of T. trichiura infection and, in contrast, it was significantly higher in the current study (P < 0.001). Overall post-CDTi prevalence of any STH infection was considerably lower than reported in the baseline (p < 0.001). It is evidenced that long-term CDTi for onchocerciasis control and elimination had additional benefits by reducing the prevalence of STH infections specifically of A. lumbricoides and hookworm, but had no impact on infections with T. trichuria.

To evaluate these innate subsets in Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection, reporter mice for myeloid cells (CX3CR1GFP ) and granulocytes (PGRPdsRED ) are employed. Nippostrongylus infection induces lung infiltration of reporter cells, including CX3CR1+ myeloid cells and PGRP+ eosinophils. Strikingly, CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice, which are deficient in CX3CR1, are protected from Nippostrongylus infection with reduced weight loss, lung leukocyte infiltration, and worm burden compared to CX3CR1+/+ mice. This protective effect is specific for CX3CR1 as CCR2-deficient mice do not exhibit reduced worm burdens. Nippostrongylus co-culture with lung Ly6C+ monocytes or CD11c+ cells demonstrates that CX3CR1GFP/GFP monocytes secrete more pro-inflammatory cytokines and actively bind the parasites causing reduced motility. RNA sequencing of Ly6C+ or CD11c+ cells shows Nippostrongylus-induced gene expression changes, particularly in monocytes, associated with inflammation, chemotaxis, and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. Analysis reveals cytotoxic and adhesion molecules as potential effectors against the parasite, such as Gzma and Gzmb, which are elevated in CX3CR1GFP/GFP monocytes.

In this study, larval stage I American lobster (Homarus americanus), a commercially important and native species of Atlantic Canada, was used as the test species. Toxicity tests were first conducted by exposing lobster larvae to a reference toxicant of copper sulphate (CuSO4) and then to physically and chemically (using Corexit 9500A) dispersed oil (WAF and CEWAF, respectively). The effect on larval survival was estimated by calculating the 24-h median effect concentration (24-h EC50), and there was no difference between WAF or CEWAF exposure when the results are reported on a total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) basis. The 24-h EC50s ranged from 2.54 to 9.73\u00a0mg TPH/L when all trials (n\u2009=\u200919) are considered together.

Faecal samples were collected from 270 dogs kept in two different shelters (160 samples) and in a marginalised Roma community (110 samples). Faecal samples were processed using the flotation method. Microscopically positive faecal samples with hookworm eggs were subjected to a coproculture and the hatched larvae were identified morphometrically, prior to molecular testing. The faecal samples with hookworm\u00b4s eggs and individual larvae were identified by a molecular assay based on the amplification of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene fragment. Further, species-specific primer sets were designed for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1 region) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) gene section.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that NdPrx4 was expressed in various tissues of N. denticulata sinensis, and the expression in ovary was the highest. It was speculated that NdPrx4 may be related to maternal immune function. Under the stimulation of Cu2+, the expression of NdPrx4 reached the peak at 36\u00a0h, and showed a downward trend until 72\u00a0h, indicating that NdPrx4 may play an important role in the stress response of N. denticulata sinensis.

Here, we examined the role of PTMs in determining the effects of a cardioactive neuropeptide, myosuppressin (pQDLDHVFLRFamide), on the whole heart, the neuromuscular junction/muscle, the isolated CG, and the neurons of the CG. Mature myosuppressin and noncyclized myosuppressin (QDLDHVFLRFamide) elicited similar and significant changes in whole heart contraction amplitude and frequency, stimulated muscle contraction amplitude and the bursting pattern of the intact and ligatured neurons of the ganglion. In the whole heart, nonamidated myosuppressin (pQDLDHVFLRFG) elicited only a small decrease in frequency and amplitude. In the absence of motor neuron input, nonamidated myosuppressin did not cause any significant changes in the amplitude of stimulated contractions. In the intact CG, nonamidated myosuppressin elicited a small but significant decrease in burst duration. Further analysis revealed a correlation between the extent of modulation elicited by nonamidated myosuppressin in the whole heart and the isolated, intact CG. When the neurons of the CG were physically decoupled, nonamidated myosuppressin elicited highly variable responses.

Besides, soil pH and phosphorus were the main factors influencing the fungal community structure. We observed a higher fungal diversity in cultivated compared to wild pearl millet. Interestingly, we detected higher relative abundance of putative pathotrophs, especially plant pathogen, in cultivated than in wild millet in semi-arid and semi-humid zones, and higher relative abundance of saprotrophs in wild millet in arid and semi-humid zones. A network analysis based on taxa co-occurrence patterns in the core mycobiome revealed that cultivated millet and wild relatives had dissimilar groups of hub taxa.

By combining RAD sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identify genetic signatures of local adaptation in mountain hares (Lepus timidus) from isolated and distinctive habitats of its wide distribution: Ireland, the Alps and Fennoscandia. Demographic modelling suggested that the split of these mountain hares occurred around 20 thousand years ago, providing the opportunity to study adaptive evolution over a short timescale. Using genome-wide scans, we identified signatures of extreme differentiation among hares from distinct geographic areas that overlap with area-specific selective sweeps, suggesting targets for local adaptation. Several identified candidate genes are associated with traits related to the uniqueness of the different environments inhabited by the three groups of mountain hares, including coat colour, ability to live at high altitudes and variation in body size. In Irish mountain hares, a variant of ASIP, a gene previously implicated in introgression-driven winter coat colour variation in mountain and snowshoe hares (L. americanus), may underlie brown winter coats, reinforcing the repeated nature of evolution at ASIP moulding adaptive seasonal colouration. Comparative genomic analyses across several hare species suggested that mountain hares' adaptive variants appear predominantly species-specific. However, using coalescent simulations, we also show instances where the candidate adaptive variants have been introduced via introgressive hybridization. Our study shows that standing adaptive variation, including that introgressed from other species, was a crucial component of the post-glacial dynamics of species.", "keywords": ["\nLepus timidus\n", "adaptive evolution", "genome scans", "introgression"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1111/mec.16338"}

Oral infection typically leads to consistent worm yields in hamsters but may not accurately reflect the clinical and immunological manifestations of human infection resulting from skin penetration. In this study we compared host responses following percutaneous infection to those utilizing an established oral infection protocol. Infected hamsters exhibited a dose-dependent pathology, with 1000 percutaneous larvae (L3) causing anemia and adult worm recovery comparable to that of 50 orally administered L3. A delayed arrival and maturity of worms in the intestine was observed, as was variation in measured cellular immune responses. A long-term study found that the decline in blood hemoglobin was more gradual and did not reach levels as low, with the nadir of disease coming later in percutaneously infected hamsters. Both groups exhibited moderate growth delay, an effect that was more persistent in the percutaneously infected group. Fecal egg output also peaked later and at lower levels in the percutaneously infected animals. In contrast to orally infected hamsters, antibody titers to larval antigens continued to increase throughout the course of the experiment in the percutaneous group. These results demonstrate that the route of infection with A. ceylanicum impacts disease pathogenesis, as well as humoral and cellular immune responses in an experimental setting.

Gli stadi dei parassiti trovati durante l\u2019esame patologico e la coprologia di routine sono stati identificati morfologicamente. Le specie di tenie (uova e stadi adulti) sono state determinate con tecniche di biologia molecolare. Inoltre, la Trichinella spp. \u00e8 stata ricercata sul tessuto muscolare linguale e diaframmatico utilizzando la tecnica di digestione artificiale seguita da PCR multiplex nei casi positivi. Tra i quattro sciacalli testati per i parassiti, sono state rilevate uova di anchilostoma in un animale, vermi adulti e uova di Echinococcus multilocularis in un altro, e nessun parassita \u00e8 stato trovato nell\u2019ultimo. Nell\u2019ultimo caso, uova di E. multilocularis, cos\u00ec come uova di Toxocara canis e sporocisti di Sarcocystis sp. sono state rilevati nel contenuto intestinale mentre le larve di Trichinella britovi sono state rilevate nei campioni di muscolo. Il programma di sorveglianza sanitaria dei carnivori protetti in Svizzera ha quindi aggiunto lo sciacallo dorato alla lista degli ospiti dei parassiti zoonotici endemici E. multilocularis e T. britovi.

A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 384 pregnant women was conducted from November 2018 to March 2019. Relevant information on potential risk factors associated with IPIs was gathered using a semistructured questionnaire. Stool samples were collected and examined using wet mount and formol-ether concentration techniques. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the possible association between dependent and independent variables. The overall prevalence of IPIs was 36.7%. Seven species of parasites were identified. The most prevalent intestinal protozoan parasite identified was Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (9.6%) followed by Giardia intestinalis (8.9%). The predominant helminth parasite identified was Ascaris lumbricoides (8.6%), followed by hookworm (5.2%), Taenia spp. (3.6%), Strongyloides stercoralis (1.3%), and Schistosoma mansoni (1.04%). Six pregnant women (1.56%) had infection by two parasite species. The odds of IPIs were higher among illiterates (AOR = 4.63), lowest monthly income earners (AOR = 3.49), primigravida (pregnant for the first time) (AOR = 2.04), those who used unboiled well/stream/river water for drinking (AOR = 14.55), ate soil (AOR = 2.32), and consumed raw vegetables (AOR = 1.91).

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminths and associated factors among adolescents and adults in Bibugn Woreda, East Gojjam, Northwest Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Bibugn Woreda from February to September 2021. Using multistage proportionate sampling technique, 641 adolescents and adults were enrolled in this study. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and factors associated with helminthic infections was collected using structured questionnaire prepared in Amharic and administered through face-to-face interview. Parasite detection in stool samples was performed using modified formol-ether concentration and Kato-Katz techniques following standard protocols. Data was entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 25. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with soil-transmitted helminths infections. P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The overall prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths infection was 20.9% (134/641). The most detected parasite was Ascaris lumbricoides (12.5%), followed by hookworm species (7.5%) and Trichuris trichiura (1.1%). Fecal egg counts revealed that 96.5% (112/116) of the infections were with light parasite intensity, while 3.5% (4/116) were with moderate parasite intensity.

Understanding sources of bias and variation is a challenge in the field of resurrection ecology, including those that arise because often-used measurements like seed germination success are imperfect indicators of propagule viability. Using a Bayesian statistical framework, we evaluated sources of variability and tested for zero-inflation and overdispersion in data from 13 germination trials of soil-stored seeds of Schoenoplectus americanus, an ecosystem engineer in coastal salt marshes in the Chesapeake Bay. We hypothesized that these two model structures align with an ecological understanding of dormancy and revival: zero-inflation could arise due to failed germinations resulting from inviability or failed attempts to break dormancy, and overdispersion could arise by failing to measure important seed traits. A model that accounted for overdispersion, but not zero-inflation, was the best fit to our data. Tetrazolium viability tests corroborated this result: most seeds that failed to germinate did so because they were inviable, not because experimental methods failed to break their dormancy. Seed viability declined exponentially with seed age and was mediated by seed provenance and experimental conditions. Our results provide a framework for accounting for and explaining variability when estimating propagule viability from soil-stored natural archives which is a key aspect of using dormant propagules in eco-evolutionary studies.", "keywords": ["Bayesian hierarchical modeling", "Schoenoplectus americanus", "germination", "resurrection ecology", "seed viability"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1111/eva.13316"}

Some remote communities which are hard-to-reach are not covered by MDA campaigns which is a major challenge to meeting elimination targets. Adequate data is necessary for formulating policies and strengthening interventions to mitigate transmission. This study assessed the infection burden of Plasmodium, Schistosoma species and STH infections among school children in communities in Southern and Northern Ghana. School children living in communities in Southern (Ada Foah, Pediatorkope, Tuanikope) and Northern (Kpalsogu) Ghana were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. A total of 493 (241 males and 252 females) school children aged (2-15\u00a0years) were enrolled in the study. Stool samples were collected to screen for Schistosoma mansoni and STH infections using the formol-ether concentration technique and urine samples were also collected to screen for S. haematobium using the routine urine examination method. Plasmodium parasitaemia was determined from thick and thin finger-prick blood samples. Overall, the prevalence of P. falciparum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm infections were 17.2% (95%CI 12.8-19.7), 22.6% (95%CI 25.2-32.7), 1.6% (95%CI 0.89-5.2), 1.2% (95%CI 0.78-4.8) and 1.2% (95%CI 0.78-4.8) respectively.

Humans can be infected by accidentally ingesting embryonated T. canis eggs from the environment or occasionally after ingesting L3 larvae from paratenic hosts. This study investigated the importance of vertical transmission and the role of puppies in the epidemiology of T. canis through the examination of fecal samples from dogs less than one year of age in Grenada, West Indies, a small island tropical developing country. Samples were stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C or in 10% formalin until microscopic examination for helminth eggs or using a rapid antigen test for the presence of protozoan species. A knowledge, attitudes and practices study was completed among dog owners, physicians and veterinary students. Of 306 dogs less than one year of age, 147 (48%) were found to have T. canis eggs. Vertical transmission was indicated by the proportion of infected dogs increasing from 50% at two weeks of age (from in utero transmission) to 70% by 12\u00a0weeks (in utero and lactogenic transmission). After 12\u00a0weeks the positivity rate dropped rapidly with no dogs over 40\u00a0weeks of age being infected. As T. canis eggs were found in puppy feces at two weeks of age, initial treatment of puppies should begin earlier, at twelve days post-partum, than currently recommended to prevent shedding of eggs. Perhaps even more importantly, treatment of pregnant dogs, preventing vertical transmission, would have a major impact on the control of T. canis infection. Knowledge of T. canis and other zoonotic helminths such as Ancylostoma caninum was found to be low among dog owners, physicians and veterinary students. None of the dog owners treated their dogs for helminths, all were unaware of the risk of zoonoses, and only 9% picked up dog feces. Efforts to prevent vertical transmission and to increase awareness and knowledge of these zoonoses could result in reducing their public health impact.", "keywords": ["Ancylostoma caninum", "Control", "Epidemiology", "Puppies", "Toxocara canis", "Vertical transmission"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1016/j.parepi.2021.e00232"}

This study analyzed biological data from more than 270,000 lobsters sampled over ten years (2010-2019) by the Fishermen and Scientists Research Society. A mixed effect logistic regression model evaluated the effect of spatial, temporal and environmental factors as well as size on the sex ratio of lobsters. There were significant temporal patterns in sex ratios that differed by LFA. After the effects of sampling month, year and LFA were accounted for, lower bottom temperature and deeper water depth were associated with a higher prevalence of females, especially in larger lobsters. We present the first long term analyses of sex ratio patterns in H.\u00a0americanus in Atlantic Canada's most commercially important region for this species and provide evidence that these patterns are influenced by environmental factors and fisheries.

Chemically diverse natural products present plausible templates to augment hookworm drug discovery. The present work utilized pharmacoinformatics techniques to predict African natural compounds ZINC95486082, ZINC95486052 and euphohelionon as potential inhibitory molecules of the hookworm Necator americanus \u03b2 tubulin gene. A library of 3390 compounds was screened against a homology-modelled structure of \u03b2 tubulin. The docking results obtained from AutoDock Vina was validated with an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.714 computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The three selected compounds had favourable binding affinities and were predicted to form no interactions with the resistance-associated mutations Phe167, Glu198 and Phe200. The compounds were predicted as anthelmintics using a Bayesian-based technique and were pharmacologically profiled to be druglike. Further molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA calculations showed the compounds as promising anthelmintic drug leads. Novel critical residues comprising Leu246, Asn247 and Asn256 were also predicted for binding. Euphohelionon was selected as a template for the de novo fragment-based design of five compounds labelled A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5; with four of them having SAscore values below 6, denoting easy synthesis. All the five de novo molecules docked firmly in the binding pocket of the \u03b2 tubulin with no binding interactions with the three known resistance mutation residues. Binding energies of -8.2, -7.6, -7.3, -7.2 and -6.8 kcal/mol were obtained for A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5, respectively. The identified compounds can serve as treasure troves from which future potent anthelmintics can be designed.

The early diagnosis of O. viverrini infection may interrupt the progression of the opisthorchiasis and other related illnesses, especially CCA. The current diagnostic procedure is stool examination by microscope-based methods such as direct smear and concentration techniques but it is limited by low parasite egg numbers. The molecular diagnosis prompts the chance to evaluate the light infection with low number of parasite eggs but is currently inconvenient for routine use due to special equipment requirement and unstable sensitivities. Our present study aims to establish the efficiency of OvNad subunits, the mitochondrial gene, for introducing as a potential diagnostic target by conventional PCR, the cheapest and easiest molecular procedure. A total of 166 stool samples were investigated microscopically by the PBS-ethyl acetate concentration technique (PECT); 75 samples were O. viverrini positive with 28 samples that were positive with single parasite (hookworm, A. lumbricoides, S. stercoralis, Taenia spp., and T. trichiura), 11 samples were with mixed infection, and 52 samples were without parasite detection. The detection limits of OvNad subunits were evaluated in artificially spiked samples containing 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Ov-eggs. The result suggested that the best detection efficacy was of OvNad5 that had exact detection limits at only 5 eggs. In the PCR amplification of OvNad subunits, there exist 100% specificities with varied sensitivities from 64%, 88%, 80%, and 100% of OvNad1, OvNad2, OvNad4, and OvNad5, respectively. OvNad subunits were amplified specifically without cross reactivity with the other collected parasites. Our study established that OvNad subunits, especially OvNad5, are the potent candidates for PCR amplification of stool containing Ov-eggs with high confidential sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV even in the light infection that would be a benefit for developing as a routine diagnosis of O. viverrini infection.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1155/2021/3957545"}

It is presently unknown which inactivating procedures may be universally effective for safe transport, preservation, and disinfection of STH-contaminated specimens, and this lack of knowledge may expose laboratory staff to higher risk of laboratory-acquired infections (LAI's). There are limited data on the efficacy of commonly used disinfectants and fecal fixatives for inactivating the eggs of STH. This work tested five disinfectants for surface cleanup, four storage temperature conditions, and six transport/storage fixatives, to inactivate eggs of three species of STH of animal origin (Ascaris suum \"roundworm,\" Trichuris vulpis \"whipworm\" and Ancylostoma caninum \"hookworm\") as surrogates for human STH. Among disinfectants, exposure to 10% povidone-iodine for \u22655 min inactivated 100% of the three species tested, while 5 min exposure to 95% ethanol inactivated T. vulpis and A. caninum eggs. All of the fixatives tested had inactivation effects on A. caninum hookworm eggs within 24\u2009h of exposure, except potassium dichromate, which required 48\u2009h. 95% ethanol for \u226548\u2009h inactivated eggs from all three STH species.

IMPORTANCE This study systematically evaluates common laboratory disinfectants and storage conditions for their effectiveness in inactivating the infective stages of soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Animal-infecting proxy species were chosen to represent three major groups of STH that infect humans: roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms. Previously published work in this area typically focuses on a particular inactivation method, either for a single STH species, or on a subset of closely related species. Because prediagnostic fecal specimens must be regarded as potentially infectious with a mix of species, such information may be of limited utility in a working laboratory. We provide a straightforward summary of storage and disinfection methods that can achieve complete inactivation across a range of STH species, which represents a significant advance for clinical, veterinary and research laboratory biosafety.", "keywords": ["STH", "biosafety", "helminth", "inactivation", "nematode", "parasite"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1128/Spectrum.01828-21"}

Since the drugs currently in use for the treatment of haemonchosis are losing their effectiveness due to the drug-resistance of this nematode, a new or repurposed drug is highly needed. As the antipsychotic drug sertraline (SRT) has been shown to be effective against the parasitic nematodes Trichuris muris, Ancylostoma caninum and Schistosoma mansoni, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible effect of SRT on H. contortus. The potential hepatotoxicity of SRT was tested in sheep, a common H. contortus host. In addition, the main metabolic pathways of SRT in H.\u00a0contortus and the ovine liver were identified. While no effect of SRT on H. contortus egg hatching was observed, SRT was found to significantly decrease the viability of H. contortus adults in drug-sensitive and resistant strains, with its effect comparable to the commonly used anthelmintics levamisole and monepantel. Moreover, SRT in anthelmintically active concentrations showed no toxicity to the ovine liver. Biotransformation of SRT in H. contortus was weak, with most of the drug remaining unmetabolized. Production of the main metabolite hydroxy-SRT did not differ significantly between strains. Other minor metabolites such as SRT-O-glucoside, dihydroxy-SRT, and SRT-ketone were also identified in H. contorts adults. Compared to H.\u00a0contortus, the ovine liver metabolized SRT more extensively, mainly via desmethylation and glucuronidation. In conclusion, the potency of SRT against H. contortus was proven, and it should be tested further toward possible repurposing.", "keywords": ["Drug repurposing", "drug metabolism", "drug resistance", "hepatotoxicity", "nematodes"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1186/s13567-021-01012-x"}

More recently, experimental hookworm infection has been performed to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of hookworm infection and for the evaluation of hookworm vaccines and chemotherapeutic interventions. Experimental human hookworm infection has been proven to be safe, with no deaths observed in over 500 participants (although early reports predate systematic adverse event reporting) and no serious adverse events described in over 200 participants enrolled in contemporary clinical trials. While experimental human hookworm infection holds significant promise, as both a challenge model for testing anti-hookworm therapies and for treating various diseases of modernity, there are many challenges that present. These challenges include preparation and storage of larvae, which has not significantly changed since Harada and Mori first described their coproculture method in 1955. In vitro methods of hookworm larval culture, storage, and the development of meaningful potency or release assays are required.

As such, this study aimed to characterize the prevalence of intestinal parasites in dogs visiting off-leash parks in the region using sucrose double centrifugation and Fecal Dx\u00ae tests. Additionally, data obtained via the sucrose double centrifugation method were used to evaluate the performance of the Fecal Dx\u00ae tests. Fecal samples were collected from 466 dogs aged \u22656\u00a0months from May to November 2018 (mean age\u00a0=\u00a03.7\u00a0years). Overall, eleven intestinal parasites were identified using sucrose double centrifugation. Roundworm eggs (Toxocara canis and Baylisascaris procyonis), hookworm eggs (Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria stenocephala), and whipworm eggs (Trichuris vulpis) were identified in 1.07% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-2.56%), 5.79% (95% CI 3.85-8.31%), and 5.15% (95% CI 3.33-7.57) of samples, respectively. Using the Fecal Dx\u00ae tests, 1.07% (95% CI 0.38-2.56%), 4.29% (95% CI 2.64-6.55%), and 2.15% (95% CI 1.03-3.91) of the samples tested positive for roundworm, hookworm, and whipworm antigen, respectively. To assess the level of agreement between the Fecal Dx\u00ae tests and sucrose double centrifugation, three methods were used. Cohen's kappa indicated a fair-to-moderate level of agreement between Fecal Dx\u00ae tests and sucrose double centrifugation. In contrast, the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa and Gwet's first-order agreement coefficient indicated almost perfect agreement between these tests, ranging from 0.87 to 0.99 among the parasites examined.

We compared the antibody profile between groups defined by P. falciparum and helminth previous exposure (based on serology) and/or current infection (determined by microscopy and/or qPCR). In multivariable regression models adjusted by demographic, socioeconomic, water, and sanitation variables, individuals exposed/infected with P. falciparum and helminths had significantly higher total IgE and antigen-specific IgG levels, magnitude (sum of all levels) and breadth of response to both types of parasites compared to individuals exposed/infected with only one type of parasite (P \u2264 0.05). There was a positive association between exposure/infection with P. falciparum and exposure/infection with helminths or the number of helminth species, and vice versa (P \u2264 0.001). In addition, children coexposed/coinfected tended (P = 0.062) to have higher P. falciparum parasitemia than those single exposed/infected.

We compared the antibody profile between groups of Mozambican individuals defined by P. falciparum and helminth previous exposure and/or current infection. Our results show a significant increase in antibody responses in individuals coexposed/coinfected with P. falciparum and helminths in comparison with individuals exposed/infected with only one of these parasites, and suggest that this increase is due to a more permissive immune environment to infection in the host. Importantly, this study takes previous exposure into account, which is particularly relevant in endemic areas where continuous infections imprint and shape the immune system. Deciphering the implications of coinfections deserves attention because accounting for the real interactions that occur in nature could improve the design of integrated disease control strategies.", "keywords": ["IgE", "IgG", "antibodies", "coinfection", "helminths", "luminex", "malaria"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1128/Spectrum.01109-21"}

This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of the novel use of a topical ivermectin formulation against hookworm infection and lice (Antarctophthirus microchir) infestation, in comparison with injected ivermectin. During the 2017 breeding season at Dangerous Reef, South Australia, pups \u2264 70\u00a0cm in standard length (\u2264 2 weeks of age; n\u00a0=\u00a085) were randomised to single dose topical (500\u00a0\u03bcg/kg spot-on; n\u00a0=\u00a027) or injected (200\u00a0\u03bcg/kg subcutaneous; n\u00a0=\u00a029) ivermectin treatment groups, or to an untreated control group (n\u00a0=\u00a029). Topical ivermectin was highly effective for U. sanguinis elimination, and not significantly different to the injected formulation (estimated effectiveness 96.4% and 96.8%, respectively; P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Its application resulted in an 81.6% reduction and 62.7% additional clearance for A. microchir infestation by 15-24 days post-treatment, compared with untreated control pups (also not significantly different to injected ivermectin; 83.1% and 59.4%, respectively; P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).

Specimens were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, Gomori-Grocott staining, Ziehl-Neelsen staining, Giemsa, and mucicarmine staining. Microscopic analysis included fluorescence, polarized light, and confocal microscopy. Microscopically, in HE coloration, hookworm eggs showed as eosinophilic. Inflammatory multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes, were usually related to the nematode eggs, forming an intense inflammatory infiltrate. Biofluorescent properties of eggs and larvae revealed to be sensitive in the detection of parasitic structures contrasting with the inflamed connective tissue. Vegetable presence was confirmed by polarized light microscopy and it was found to be associated with microbial biofilms. Confocal microscopy has showed to be an excellent method for morphotype differentiation of parasitic eggs. Parasitic infection and vegetable matter displayed similarities in the inflammatory response, but the latter can rot and agglomerate biofilms. The microscopic diagnosis of such infections requires the interpretation of challenging morphological features since the parasites are usually sectioned and mixed with an inflammatory reaction. These histochemical approaches proved to be excellent to distinguish both lesions.", "keywords": ["ancylostomiasis", "denture", "hookworm", "oral parasite", "vegetable matter"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1002/jemt.24005"}

The identification of hookworm-derived anti-inflammatory molecules is urgently needed for future translational research. The emergence of metabolomics has become a powerful approach to comprehensively characterize metabolic alterations in recent times. Herein, excretory and secretory products (ESPs) were collected from cultured adult worm, while small intestinal contents were obtained from Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N. brasiliensis, Nb)-infected mice. Through ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) platform, metabolomics analysis was used to explore the identification of anti-inflammatory molecules. Out of 45 differential metabolites that were discovered from ESPs, 10 of them showed potential anti-inflammatory properties, which could be subclassed into amino acids, furanocoumarins, linear diarylheptanoids, gamma butyrolactones, and alpha-keto acids. In terms of intestinal contents that were derived from N. brasiliensis-infected mice, 14 out of 301 differential metabolites were discovered to demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects, with possible subclassification into amino acids, benzylisoquinolines, quaternary ammonium salts, pyrimidines, pregnane steroids, purines, biphenyls, and glycerophosphocholines. Furthermore, nine of the differential metabolites appeared both in ESPs and infected intestinal contents, wherein four were proven to show anti-inflammation properties, namely, L-glutamine, glutamine (Gln), pyruvate, and alanine-Gln (Ala-Gln). In summary, we have provided a method for the identification and analysis of parasite-derived molecules with potential anti-inflammatory properties in the present study. This array of anti-inflammatory metabolites could provide clues for future evaluation and translational study of these anti-inflammatory molecules.", "keywords": ["Nippostrongylus brasiliensis", "anti-inflammatory activity", "hookworm", "host\u2013pathogen interactions", "metabolomics approach"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3389/fcimb.2021.781132"}

Ocean acidification effects on juvenile stages had the largest stage-specific impacts on the population, while cumulative effects across life stages significantly exerted the greatest impacts, albeit quite minimal. Reducing fishing pressure leads to overall increases in population abundance while setting minimum size limits also results in more higher-priced market-sized lobsters (>\u20091\u00a0lb), and could help mitigate the negative impacts of OA and concurrent stressors (warming, deoxygenation). However, the magnitude of increased effects of climate change overweighs any moderate population gains made by changes in fishing pressure and size limits, reinforcing that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is most pressing and that climate-adaptive fisheries management is necessary as a secondary role to ensure population resiliency. We suggest possible strategies to mitigate impacts by preserving important population demographics.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-02253-8"}

Plasma IL-2, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 concentrations were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The median CD4+ T cell frequency was significantly higher in hookworm-infected children than healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, hookworm-infected children had a significantly increased absolute number of Tregs. No differences in circulating CD8+ T cell median frequency or absolute numbers were observed among hookworm-infected children or healthy controls. Elevated IL-2 and IL-10 concentrations were found in hookworm-infected children. Moreover, the absolute number of Tregs was significantly positively correlated with the plasma IL-10 concentration (rs\u2009=\u20090.406, P\u2009=\u20090.029). This study showed that hookworm-infected schoolchildren had significantly different immune responses than healthy controls, including an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, a significant induction of Tregs and significantly elevated circulating IL-10 levels.

Both bacteria 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas) and 'Candidatus Liberibacter americanus' (CLam) are associated with HLB in Brazil but with a strong prevalence of CLas over CLam. Conventionally, HLB management focuses on controlling the insect vector population (Diaphorina citri; also known as Asian citrus psyllid [ACP]) by spraying insecticides, an approach demonstrated to be mostly ineffective. Thus, development of novel, more efficient HLB control strategies is required. The multifunctional bacterial outer membrane protein OmpA is involved in several molecular processes between bacteria and their hosts and has been suggested as a target for bacterial control. Curiously, OmpA is absent in CLam in comparison with CLas, suggesting a possible role in host interaction. Therefore, in the current study, we have treated ACPs with different OmpA-derived peptides, aiming to evaluate acquisition of CLas by the insect vector. Treatment of psyllids with 5 \u00b5M of Pep1, Pep3, Pep5, and Pep6 in artificial diet significantly reduced the acquisition of CLas, whereas increasing the concentration of Pep5 and Pep6 to 50 \u00b5M abolished this process. In addition, in planta treatment with 50 \u00b5M of Pep6 also significantly decreased the acquisition of CLas, and sweet orange plants stably absorbed and maintained this peptide for as long as 3 months post the final application.

Immunomodulation by helminth infections could influence the occurrence of FRTIs. This study aimed to investigate the association between FRTIs, hookworm infections, and sociodemographic factors in six rural areas of the central region of Togo. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographical information, and parasitological assessments were used to diagnose helminth infections. Moreover, cytobacteriological examination of vaginal swabs was performed for the diagnosis of candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis (BV), and real-time PCR method was used to determine sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Finally, a logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship and association of these factors to FRTIs. The prevalence of FRTIs was 82.3% including STIs (74.38%), BV (31.79%), and vulvovaginal candidiasis (9.85%). In detail, FRTIs were caused by bacteria such as Ureaplasma parvum (50%), Ureaplasma urealyticum (26.5%), and Mycoplasma hominis (17.5%) and viruses such us cytomegalovirus (5%) and human papilloma virus (HPV) (20%). No cases of Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum, or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were observed. Interestingly, women who had hookworm infections were at high risk of HPV. The use of condoms was a protective factor [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.23; 95% CI [0.11-0.51)], while the use of contraceptive methods was a risk factor [aOR = 2.49; 95% CI (1.19-5.19)] for STIs. The risk of BV was lower among participants who had more than four pregnancies [aOR = 0.27; 95% CI (0.11-0.65)]. Furthermore, women who had ever been paid for sexual intercourse were at high probability risk of vulvovaginal candidiasis [aOR = 16.92; 95% CI (1.46-196.48)]. This study highlighted risk factors associated with FRTIs, the control of which would help to reduce the incidence of these diseases. Health-care professionals could develop education and sensitization strategies based on these risk factors, and anti-hookworm treatment concepts may be taken into consideration to minimize the risk of HPV infections.", "keywords": ["central region of Togo", "female reproductive tract infections", "helminth infections", "risk factors", "rural areas"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2021.738894"}

In 2015, a total of 20 survey sites were sampled in 10 counties (cities) of Yunnan Province using the stratified cluster random sampling method. Stool samples were collected from all local permanent residents at ages of one year and older in each survey site, and the soil-borne nematode eggs were identified using the modified Kato-Katz technique and the egg number was counted. In addition, the hookworm species was identified using the filter-paperculture method, and Enterobius vermicularis eggs were detected using the cellophane tape method in children at ages of 3 to 6 years. A total of 5 067 residents received stool examinations, and 950 residents were detected with soil-borne nematode infections, with an overall prevalence rate of 18.75%. The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichura and hookworm was 7.52%, 8.47% and 9.02%, respectively. Among 446 children detected using the cellophane tape method, 5 children were detected with E. vermicularis infections. Among the 160 residents with hookworm infections, there were 139 residents with Necator americanus infections (86.88%), 16 with A. duodenale infections (10.00%) and 5 with mixed infections (3.12%). Mild A. lumbricoides (67.98%, 259/381), T. trichura (88.58%, 380/429) and hookworm infections (94.53%, 432/457) were predominant. Among the four ecological zones, the highest prevalence of human soilborne nematode infections was found in the East Tibet-South Sichuan Ecological Zone (31.79%), and among the 10 survey counties (cities), the greatest prevalence was seen in Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County (50.13%), while the lowest prevalence was found in Ninglang Yi Autonomous County (0.40%). The prevalence of human soil-borne nematode infections was 5.67% (43/759), 26.67% (610/2 287) and 14.70% (297/2 021) in high-, moderate- and low-economic-level regions, respectively.

Soil-transmitted helminth infections rank among the most important neglected tropical diseases in terms of morbidity, and almost one billion people are still infected with at least one species. While anthelmintic drugs are available, they do not offer long term protection against reinfection, precipitating the need for vaccines that provide long-term immunologic defense. Vaccine discovery and development is in advanced clinical development for hookworm infection, with a bivalent human hookworm vaccine in clinical trials in Brazil and Africa, but is in its infancy for both roundworm (ascariasis) and whipworm (trichuriasis) infections. One of the greatest hurdles to developing soil-transmitted helminth vaccines is the potent immunoregulatory properties of these helminths, creating a barrier to the induction of meaningful long-term protective immunity. While challenging for vaccinologists, this phenomenon presents unique opportunities to develop an entirely new class of anti-inflammatory drugs that capitalise on these immunomodulatory strategies. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials employing experimental soil-transmitted helminth challenge models, when coupled with findings from animal models, show that at least some soil-transmitted helminth-derived molecules can protect against the onset of autoimmune, allergic and metabolic disorders, and several natural products with the desired bioactivity have been isolated and tested in pre-clinical settings.

Multiplex PCR did not present cross-reaction with other intestinal parasites, and the detection limit for multiplex PCR was between 2 and 20 pg of genomic DNA. In addition it presented a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.4% for S. stercoralis and 90.3% for hookworms with a specificity of 100% and 87.6%, respectively. PCR identified a higher proportion (p <0.01) of coinfections (15.3%) than microscopic techniques (3.5%).

In the current study, we have conducted the first metabolomic and lipidomic analysis of the infective third-stage filariform larvae (L3) of the predominant human hookworm Necator americanus using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Altogether, we have identified a total of 645 small molecules that were mainly produced through amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Putatively, 495 metabolites were unique to the somatic tissue extract, and 34 metabolites were present only in the ESP component. More than 21 novel mass features with nitrogen and sulfur functional groups were detected in the ESP component for the first time from helminths. While this study could not establish the biological functions of the metabolites identified, literature searches revealed that these metabolites possess various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory activities. These metabolites are likely used by the parasite upon exposure to a host to facilitate skin penetration, passage through different tissues, and immune regulation in the small bowel. Overall, the results presented herein offer significant insight into the metabolome of N.\u00a0americanus L3 and have the potential to instigate future work to establish biomarkers of infection.

At a short timescale, responses in both muscles were dominated by facilitation, albeit with different frequency and time dependence. Realistic burst stimulations revealed more substantial differences. Across bursts, cpv2a showed transient depression, whereas cpv2b showed transient facilitation. Steady-state responses to bursting input also differed substantially. Neither muscle had a monotonic dependence on frequency, but cpv2b showed particularly pronounced bandpass filtering. Cpv2a was sensitive to changes in both burst frequency and intra-burst spike frequency, whereas, despite its much slower responses, cpv2b was largely insensitive to changes in burst frequency. Cpv2a was sensitive to both burst duration and number of spikes per burst, whereas cpv2b was sensitive only to the former parameter. Neither muscle showed consistent sensitivity to changes in the overall spike interval structure, but cpv2b was surprisingly sensitive to changes in the first intervals in each burst, a parameter known to be regulated by dopamine (DA) modulation of spike propagation of the presynaptic axon.

STHs disproportionately impact socio-economically disadvantaged communities including minority indigenous populations. This systematic review aimed to quantify the prevalence of STH infection within minority indigenous populations of the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines following a published protocol. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of STH infection, and meta-regression analysis was used to quantify associations with study characteristics. Where comparative data were available, sub-group analysis was conducted to evaluate the risk of STH infection in minority indigenous people relative to other population groups. The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated visually using Forest plots and was assessed quantitatively by the index of heterogeneity (I2) and Cochran Q-statistics. From 1,366 unique studies that were identified, 81 were included in the final analysis.

The stratified analysis showed that the prevalence of infection for STH overall and for each STH species were not significantly different in minority indigenous participants compared to other populations groups.

Although it is difficult to accurately determine the geographical origin of infections, it is important to note that Sy. (D.) resticula and Su. halli are reported for the first time in Brazil. Additionally, the absence of the former species infecting hosts where the widespread and generalist Sy. (D.) nasuta was found may indicate that Sy.

Hares with the strongest preference for high-quality spruce lost on average 2.2% less weight than hares who ate the least high-quality spruce relative to low-quality spruce. The results supported our energetic predictions as follows: hares in colder temperatures and with less-insulative coats (lower % white) consumed more spruce and were less selective towards high-quality spruce.

R. Br.) spikelets, observed as temper in ceramics dating to the third millennium BC, provide the earliest evidence for the cultivation and domestication process of this crop in northern Mali. Additional sherds from the same region dating to the fifth and fourth millennium BC were examined and found to have pearl millet chaff with wild morphologies. In addition to studying sherds by stereomicroscopy and subjecting surface casts to scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we also deployed X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) on eleven sherds. This significantly augmented the total dataset of archaeological pearl millet chaff remains from which to document the use of the wild pearl millet as ceramic temper and the evolution of its morphology over time. Grain sizes were also estimated from spikelets preserved in the ceramics. Altogether, we are now able to chart the evolution of domesticated pearl millet in western Africa using three characteristics: the evolution of nonshattering stalked involucres; the appearance of multiple spikelet involucres, usually paired spikelets; and the increase in grain size. By the fourth millennium BC, average grain breadth had increased by 28%, although spikelet features otherwise resemble the wild type. In the third millennium BC, the average width of seeds is 38% greater than that of wild seeds, while other qualitative features of domestication are indicated by the presence of paired spikelets and the appearance of nondehiscent, stalked involucres. Nonshattering spikelets had probably become fixed by around 2000 BC, while increases in average grain size continued into the second millennium BC. These data now provide a robust sequence for the morphological evolution of domesticated pearl millet, the first indigenous crop domesticated in western Africa.

We find that infrequent yet consistent hog foraging and trampling suppresses dominant plants by generating a perpetually disturbed habitat that favors competitively inferior species and disallows full vegetative recovery over time. Along borders between plant monocultures, trampling destroys dominant graminoids responsible for most aboveground marsh biomass while competitively inferior plants increase fivefold. Hog activities shift the brackish marsh disturbance regime from pulse to press, which changes the plant community: competitively inferior plants increase coverage, species diversity is doubled, and live cover is lowered by 30% as large plants are unable to take hold in hog-disturbed areas. Release from disturbance does not result in complete recovery (i.e., dominant plant monocultures) because hog consumer control is a combination of both top-down control and broader engineering effects. These results highlight how habitats are susceptible to invasive effects outside of structural destruction alone, especially if large consumers are pervasive over time and change the dynamics that sustain recovery.", "keywords": ["\nJuncus romerianus\n", "\nSchoenoplectus americanus\n", "\nSpartina cynosuroides\n", "\nSus scrofa\n", "competition", "feral swine", "marsh grass", "pigs"], "year": 2022, "doi": "10.1002/ecy.3572"}

Some regions are reaching WHO goals, but transmission could rebound if strategies are discontinued without an epidemiological evaluation. For that, sensitive diagnostic methods to detect low intensity infections and localization of ongoing transmission are crucial. In this work, we estimated and compared the STH infection as obtained by different diagnostic methods in a low intensity setting. We conducted a cross-sectional study enrolling 792 participants from a district in Mozambique. Two stool samples from two consecutive days were collected from each participant. Samples were analysed by Telemann, Kato-Katz and qPCR for STH detection. We evaluated diagnostic sensitivity using a composite reference standard. By geostatistical methods, we estimated neighbourhood prevalence of at least one STH infection for each diagnostic method. We used environmental, demographical and socioeconomical indicators to account for any existing spatial heterogeneity in infection. qPCR was the most sensitive technique compared to composite reference standard: 92% (CI: 83%- 97%) for A. lumbricoides, 95% (CI: 88%- 98%) for T. trichiura and 95% (CI: 91%- 97%) for hookworm. qPCR also estimated the highest neighbourhood prevalences for at least one STH infection in a low intensity setting. While 10% of the neighbourhoods showed a prevalence above 20% when estimating with single Kato-Katz from one stool and Telemann from one stool, 86% of the neighbourhoods had a prevalence above 20% when estimating with qPCR. In low intensity settings, STH estimated prevalence of infection may be underestimated if based on Kato-Katz. qPCR diagnosis outperformed the microscopy methods. Thus, implementation of qPCR based predictive maps at STH control and elimination programmes would disclose hidden transmission and facilitate targeted interventions for transmission interruption.", "keywords": [], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0009803"}

Coastal marine ecosystems may be exposed to agricultural pesticides via runoff and pesticide exposure can impact the health and survival of non-target species such as the American lobster (Homarus americanus). In the current study, the gene expression changes of H. americanus stage IV larvae were evaluated to understand the physiological mechanisms affected by exposure to sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos. After 48\u00a0h chlorpyrifos exposure, surviving lobsters were processed for Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Genes of interest that showed significant changes using RNA-seq were verified using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Analysis of RNA-seq and the confirmation of gene expression patterns via RT-qPCR found altered expression in genes related to stress response (glutathione peroxidase 3 and heat shock protein 60), hypoxia response (hairy, astakine 2, hemocyanin), moulting (cytochrome P450 307a1 and chitinase), and immunity (astakine 2) pathways. Changes to gene expression were most notable in lobsters exposed to 0.57\u00a0\u03bcg/L chlorpyrifos.", "keywords": ["Decapod", "Illumina HiSeq", "Organophosphate", "Pesticide", "RNA sequencing"], "year": 2021, "doi": "10.1016/j.cbd.2021.100918"}
